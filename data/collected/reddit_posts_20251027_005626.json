    "title": "Added height ruler to my iOS photogrammetry app",
    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

And what do we hear? Not even English language - a russian guy using the russian language, trying to find a made-up issue and postpone any releases.\n\nIt especially happens when we release volunteer apps, or even military support ones (they just simply hate this).\n\nWhat are your thoughts, and what actions can we take here?\n",

    "title": "Reps – I built the fitness coach I couldn't afford (uses all that Apple Watch data nobody seems to do anything with)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/apple!\n\nRecent grad here entering a brutal job market and keeping myself busy building things myself and others want! I'm also someone who's been frustrated by a problem for a long time: my Apple Watch collects so much health data, and nobody does anything with it really.\n\n**The Problem I'm Solving**\n\nReal fitness coaches are amazing. They track your workouts, monitor your nutrition, adjust plans based on recovery, and actually look at your sleep quality before programming your next session. But they can cost $200-500+/month, which I absolutely cannot afford right now.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm wearing an Apple Watch that tracks heart rate variability, resting heart rate, VO2 max, sleep stages and quality, daily activity and calories, and my complete workout history. Plus I have a smart scale that tracks body fat, muscle mass, water content and a water bottle that logs intake. All this data just... sits there. Fitness apps show you graphs, but they don't actually USE it to coach you.\n\nSo I built Reps, an app that acts like a real fitness coach by actually analyzing all that data.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nEvery time you want to work out, the app pulls 30+ health metrics from HealthKit (sleep quality, HRV, recent workout load, recovery status, etc.), analyzes your nutrition from photo-based meal logging (just snap a pic), considers when you last worked out and what muscle groups need attention, then uses AI to generate a personalized workout or recommend rest.\n\nIt's like having a coach who knows your sleep was terrible last night, sees you haven't trained legs in 5 days, and knows you just had a big meal 2 hours ago, then creates an appropriate workout based on all of that.\n\n**The Technical Journey**\n\nI started building this when Apple announced the Foundation Models framework at WWDC. I was incredibly excited about on-device AI: true privacy, no API costs, fast responses. Unfortunately Foundation Models wasn't ready. The quality wasn't there, was slow and often outright failed to generate a response. So I paused.\n\nRecently, I decided to ship anyway using Google Gemini as the AI backend while Foundation Models matures. Got it working well, and then a week ago I saw other devs on Threads successfully using Foundation Models. A couple hours later I had it integrated, working and out to TestFlight.\n\nThe current approach uses Foundation Models (on-device, private) where possible, with Gemini API as fallback for older devices and heavy data analysis. Not everyone has a newer iPhone, and even if they do, Foundation Models needs to be \"installed\" and \"ready\", so Gemini ensures everyone gets a great experience while Apple's ML stack improves. The eventual goal is 100% on-device with Private Cloud Compute. I frankly do not want any of your data and have no use for it and so I don't log or store any health data. If you do give the app a go, please do send feedback as I've been using user feedback and implementing features and fixing bugs rapid fire!\n\n**Why This Matters to Me**\n\nI build apps by solving my own problems. I wanted an affordable fitness coach, something that actually uses my Apple Watch data intelligently, photo-based food logging (I'm not manually entering meals...many of which don't even show up as an option in other apps), and complete privacy. Although there may be several apps out there that do meal tracking, workout planning etc, I've yet to find one that does it all together in one app using native tools, a nice UI and a low cost (not a fan of having to pay $5.99 on a per app basis to track water consumption, to track meals, to track workouts etc...)\n\n**Shipping Fast, Iterating Faster**\n\nI'm very responsive to user feedback. On October 13th I added barcode scanning for packaged foods after a user requested it. The next day, the same user wanted multi-photo support where one photo has the barcode and others show the prepared meal for context, so the AI could merge nutritional data from the package with visual analysis of the actual portions. Had that shipped to TestFlight by that evening.\n\nThere are definitely bugs, but the app can only get better as Apple's Foundation Models improve, more users test and provide feedback, and AI models get smarter. I'm quite active on Threads and sharing my journey as I build in public if you'd like to follow along!\n\n**The Vision**\n\nBuild something as good as a real fitness coach (and eventually better), because real coaches are expensive and I can't afford one, I have all the hardware already (Apple Watch, smart scale, connected water bottle), and the data exists.\n\n**App Store:** [https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/reps-your-ai-fitness-coach/id6746460451)\n\nWould love feedback from this community, especially if you're someone who feels like their Apple Watch data is being wasted. What features would you like me to add? Anything you miss from another app or find another app doesn't do (or not well)? I'm all ears!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPS: I've shipped an update with a bunch more bug fixes and improvements (22 builds worth). Should be out within \\~24 hours hopefully! I'm now gonna look into making some nice widgets and improving the workout UI/UX :)\n\n  \nEdit: The above update is out and a new one is brewing with some fun new features + bug fixes based on feedback I've gotten. Also Reps is at around 600 installs! woohoo. Thank you so much :) So excited for what's coming and what's possible!",

Reorder and hide forecast variables to create your perfect setup\n* **Widget-first design** \\- Tapping takes you directly to the detailed forecast, not just the app homepage. Configure your locations once and use the app via widgets only\n* **Information density** \\- More weather data in one place than any other weather widget\n* **Professional forecasts** \\- Powered by meteoblue, which uses 30+ weather models to generate the ideal forecast for each location\n\nI recorded a [video showing the configuration ](https://youtu.be/Ymlucp8niQQ)in action. You can also [read the release blog post](https://sonuby.com/blog/announcements/introducing-customizable-widgets-for-iphone-ipad/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\nSmall and medium widgets are free for everyone. Large widgets and customization features are for Enthusiast subscribers.\n\nTo celebrate the widget release, I'm giving away 10 one-year subscriptions in the comments. You can also test the Enthusiast subscription for 7 days.\n\nCan't wait to hear what you think! :)",

    "title": "[TestFlight] LexiSponge: Capture and Learn Foreign Language (iOS / macOS / WatchOS)",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working on an app to help with immersing in foreign languages, and it's finally ready to share with you all!\n\nThink of it as your \"***second brain***\" or a handy tool for picking up new languages. It lets you easily grab and pull out foreign language words from your surroundings and content you come across:\n\n* You can just copy and paste a chunk of (foreign language) text.\n* You can snap a picture of signs, menus, textbook sections, or anything else.\n* You can record captions from TV shows, someone talking, YouTube videos, or anything else.\n\nThe app will then help you extract individual words from your capture, turn them into their neutral forms, and machine-translate them. You can then manage them: edit them, tag them, mark which ones you know well and which ones you're still learning. Your \"context\" vocabulary can then be used in other parts of the app:\n\n* You can create flashcards from them and review them in a spaced repetition schedule.\n* It has a \"***Smart Subtitles***\" feature that generates live captions and translates the X least frequent words you don't know or are learning (so you can focus on what's being said and how instead of just reading full sentence translations).\n* (I'm also thinking of adding other features, like quizzes or AI chat, that could use your vocabulary.)\n\nAs for the languages it supports, you can use it for any language, but the capture and translation features are limited to what's available on iOS:\n\n* The app can capture images in Arabic, Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese, in simplified or traditional characters), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n* For audio capture, including live captions, you can capture Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin, English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n* Machine translation is available for Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.\n\nIn addition to these features, the app also offers:\n\n* Phonetic / Romanized transcriptions for Chinese, including pinyin support for Mandarin and jyutping support for Cantonese.\n* Offline support, so if you download the AI models on iOS, your capture features can work offline (though accuracy might be slightly lower).\n* Cloud sync, allowing your vocabulary to be synced across your devices (iPhone, iPad, Watch, or MacBook via Catalyst) if you have available storage and enabled syncing.\n* Anki deck import, letting you import (textual) Anki decks for study within the app.\n* Adding most common words by frequency.\n* Apple Watch support, so you can review your flashcards on Apple Watch.\n\nI'm planning to add even more features, but if you’re interested in trying it out, you can join its Discord server: [https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9](https://discord.gg/CjfPa6BNR9).\n\nOn the Discord server, you'll find a link to its TestFlight and channels for reporting bugs or commenting on its features. I'm really looking forward to hearing your feedback!",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

    "selftext": "Hi y’all, per user requests, I added a feature to my [photogrammetry app Sapling](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3d-scanner-sapling/id6450019198) that goes above and beyond Reality Capture and sample apps. I already added a turntable mode where you can put an object on a rotating surface like a lazy Susan, so you can image capture twice as fast. (to process on the device you still have to have a device with LIDAR with an A14 Bionic chip or later - as available on the iPhone 14 Pro and other later pro iPhones and iPads)\n\nThe downside was that this non-LIDAR mode doesn't give an automatic bounding box that tells you the exact dimensions of the object.\n\nSo I did two new things:\n\n1. Added a field where you input the height of the object and we scale it for you.\n2. Added this field so that you can edit a file after a scan, after the fact.\n3. Also added a little 3D ruler to help you get the height on the spot.\n\nHere is a video of the height ruler in action [https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821](https://www.tiktok.com/@wattmaller/video/7565222558979607821)\n\nAlso new in this version:\n\n* You can upload your existing USDZs into the app!\n* iPad now supports landscape mode even for scanning.\n* Liquid Glass adjustments for iOS 26.\n\nAs for going beyond Reality Capture, this app allows for the following:\n\n* Making more than 3 guided passes in object capture for higher quality scans (which is not available from sample apps).\n* A companion Mac app that comes with even more, higher quality processing options.\n* The area mode capture mentioned above, which goes beyond the stock Reality Composer offering on iPhone and iPad.\n* The aforementioned turntable mode that can make capturing enough images for processing 2x faster.\n* The generative AI functionality with [Meshy.ai](http://meshy.ai/).\n* Exporting all of your captured images from a session to another device.\n* Exporting to the multiple filetypes (STL, PLY, OBJ) for 3D printing and game assets.\n* Automatic Syncing with our companion Vision Pro app, where you can try out the objects you scanned in your space, and also use the AI functionality on the fly.\n\nFor folks whose device doesn’t support LIDAR/on-device object capture, processing the images on the Mac app still works wonders, and, again, we make it easy to export what you’ve captured.\n\nAlso, for folks here who would rather not have a subscription (which I have mostly to allow for AI features), for a limited time I've slashed the cost of the one-time purchase of the app in half at $20.   \n  \nI hope you enjoy!",

    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI started building Lungy in 2020 during the first COVID lockdown in London whilst working as a junior doctor. Lungy is an iPhone app that responds to breathing in real-time and was designed to make breathing exercises more engaging and beneficial to do. It’s been two years since Lungy launched and it's had a huge update since then and complete redesign. We rebuilt the whole app, and added a real-time 3D soft body solver which gives some really cool interactions like blobs / objects that inflate as you breathe; you can now dial in custom exercises and I added some Apple Watch support. We also made a version for Vision Pro, called 'Lungy Spaces'.\n\nLungy has a fully functioning free version, with subscription unlocking all features ($24.99 - $39.99 per year), with a current discount on Lifetime access (75% off - $19.99). Its functionality is very different to most breathing apps:\n\n*  instead of just following a timer, it responds as you breathe: it can use the iPhone microphone (and optionally camera too) to recognise and detect your breathing - this drives the interactive visuals. Exercises respond to touch too, and each visual has a different touch and breath interaction.\n*  it can give personalised feedback after each exercise, and you can see the volume you have breathed out over time (approximately)\n* you can configure and customise everything about the exercises - dial in exact timings, change the visuals, change the music\n* it has doctor-developed learning materials on self-care\n\nI'm delighted to say Lungy has now been featured as App of the Day in 50+ countries now and we're close to finishing a medical device version, for patients with asthma, which should hopefully undergo early trials in the UK in 2026.\n\nThanks for reading - hope you manage to try it and would love to hear any feedback!\n\n[https://www.lungy.app](https://www.lungy.app/)  \n[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1545223887)\n\n\\*\\* To access the lifetime offer ($19.99) - go to the Today screen on Lungy, there is a 'Limited Offer' button, just below 'Ambient Breathing' - tap on that to redeem. Any issues - please message on here.",

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for improvement when designing for repairability, especially where Apple’s complex engineering is concerned. So the big question remaining from this year's big M5 announcement is: did Apple upgrade the MacBook Pro’s repairability?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I’d like to share the app I’ve been working on for some time and released recently.\n\nI’ve been struggling a lot with focusing on my tasks, especially after I started working full-time time and it was tough to combine studying Japanese and working. I tried to use apps like Forest, but they felt too generic for me, like a bit improved standard timer on my phone. I liked LoFi girl and the concept behind her, but that wasn’t an actual app, just a collection of lofi beats.\n\nThat’s why I decided to make my own app that will combine both of the best worlds, and I called her Miyu. \n\nI’m not an artist (not even close, no), and I didn’t have the money to hire cool artists, so I created the character using Japanese software called VRoid. And she turned out to be pretty cute (at least for me, heh)! You can have chats with Miyu, get to know her better, and just enjoy being study-buddies. \n\nThe app is available for free, and a subscription is offered to those who want more features and limited outfits that will appear every month starting from December. I’m also working on new cool features like blocking apps while focusing, widgets, Watch support, and more!\n\nYou can check Miyu here: [https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/study-timer-friend-miyu/id6743077900?l=en-US)\n\nI would be very happy if you try it out and share your thoughts! There is still a looooong way to go for my app, so I’m actively looking for ideas to improve it. \n\nThank you! ",

I've turned off all things that should be turned off, and also shot at 48MP and at 12MP (oddly 12MP seems to be better).  \n  \nAnother poster commented that its to do with over processing in computational photography. Be that as it may, this is completely unacceptable for a £1000 phone, marketed as having a dedicated telephoto lens, because it's actually worse than 12 pro even at telephoto lengths. It's at any length. \n\nI'm a photographer, so I notice these things. But I'm going to be returning the 17 pro and sticking with my 12 pro. If anyone has any thoughts please share. Which phone the photos are shot on is noted below. I can share more examples. Maybe I've got a dud version of the 17 pro, but there are other threads on reddit speaking to it. \n\n[https://ibb.co/4whc8jWx](https://ibb.co/4whc8jWx)\n\n[https://ibb.co/S7JggdGN](https://ibb.co/S7JggdGN)\n\n[https://ibb.co/1GbYP5Gc](https://ibb.co/1GbYP5Gc)\n\n[https://ibb.co/4RCYWqjt](https://ibb.co/4RCYWqjt)\n\nThanks.

So far, i really like the phone and it feels like a huuge upgrade, however when it comes to Face ID, its absolutely horrible compared to the XR. Luckily enough, my XR is still alive and well and i could test them side by side. The XR hasn’t failed once. The 16PM, if im not straight and looking directly to it, it just doesn’t unlock. Its very inconvenient and i have tried “alternative look ” and “face mask” too. Has anybody else expected this too ? Is this something that will get better the more i use the phone or i should just go back to the apple store and ask them to check it out?",

    "selftext": " \n\n**General advice for those concerned about their battery from the Support FAQ Wiki:**\n\n**Battery health**\n\nBattery health depends on usage and a variety of other factors. It is normal to see a decrease in battery health by 7-10% per year, resulting in a battery health of 80-85% after 2 years. This number can fluctuate, remain the same, or decrease quickly over a small period and should not cause undue concern.\n\nApple recommend battery replacement when your device falls below 80% battery health if you notice reduced battery life. If it falls below 80% within the first year you may be eligable for a free battery replacement. It fails after your warranty, it's a $69-$89 USD replacement cost for a battery. Contact Apple Support [here](https://getsupport.apple.com/solutions).\n\nYou can find more information about battery health and performance from Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208387).\n\nYou can check the cycles count with [Coconut Battery for Mac](https://coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/) or [iCopyBot for Windows](https://www.icopybot.com/download.htm).\n\n​\n\n**Battery life**\n\nIssues relating to battery life can be categorised in three ways:\n\n1. Normal battery life that is to be expected due to use\n2. Reduced battery life caused by a recent update, iOS indexing, an iOS bug, or a third-party application\n3. Reduced battery life, or other abnormalities such as overheating or sudden power-off, caused by device or battery aging\n\nIf you experience issues with your battery:\n\n1. Check your battery health. If it is below 80% or you are experiencing issues you suspect are related to device or battery age, see [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n2. If you have a new or recently updated/restored device, wait a number of days for background process to complete. If you continue to have issues, wait for a further iOS update. If you are on iOS Beta, you can expect to have a decreased battery life.\n3. Review the advice below on [maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance)\n4. Consider restoring your device.\n5. If issues persist, contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/).\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery life](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance) \\- the amount of time your device runs before it needs to be recharged.\n\n* Use low power mode (This reduces mail fetch, turns off background app refresh and increases the auto lock timer)\n* Remove apps from background app refresh\n* Ensure auto lock is on\n* Turn off auto brightness and manually reduce brightness\n* Use dark mode if your device has an OLED display\n* Clearing background apps from the app switcher does not improve battery life\n\n​\n\n[Maximising battery lifespan](https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/maximizing-performance/) \\- the amount of time your battery lasts until it needs to be replaced.\n\n* Avoid extreme temperatures\n* If you notice that your iPhone gets hot when charging, remove it from its case\n* Store your iPhone in a cool place, switched off, and half-charged if not using it for long periods - and charge it every 6 months when in storage",

The performance is fantastic, I’m using ca. 60% of battery per day with normal use. And I haven’t missed the telephoto lens as of yet.\n\nI love the green colour and my wife’s blue is close to her blue 13 Pro and she’s also really happy with it.\n\nAll in all, no regrets - best regular iPhone (value wise) to date. Especially with the basic storage being up with the same price.\n\nAs for my personal feelings towards the pro phones - a bit too utilitarian with limited colour choices, while the Air is too limited for the price and posing as premium.",

So far, i really like the phone and it feels like a huuge upgrade, however when it comes to Face ID, its absolutely horrible compared to the XR. Luckily enough, my XR is still alive and well and i could test them side by side. The XR hasn’t failed once. The 16PM, if im not straight and looking directly to it, it just doesn’t unlock. Its very inconvenient and i have tried “alternative look ” and “face mask” too. Has anybody else expected this too ? Is this something that will get better the more i use the phone or i should just go back to the apple store and ask them to check it out?",

Ever since the update, my phone feels noticeably slower — laggy animations, slight frame drops, apps take longer to launch, and overall the UI just doesn’t feel as smooth as before.\n\nA few questions for anyone who knows:\n\t•\tIs there any way to roll back to the previous iOS version?\n\t•\tAre Apple still signing the older version for this device?\n\t•\tOr is this just something I have to wait for a bug fix update for?\n\nIf anyone has tips to restore performance or temporary fixes, please share. I really regret updating and would love to get the older version back if possible.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

The performance is fantastic, I’m using ca. 60% of battery per day with normal use. And I haven’t missed the telephoto lens as of yet.\n\nI love the green colour and my wife’s blue is close to her blue 13 Pro and she’s also really happy with it.\n\nAll in all, no regrets - best regular iPhone (value wise) to date. Especially with the basic storage being up with the same price.\n\nAs for my personal feelings towards the pro phones - a bit too utilitarian with limited colour choices, while the Air is too limited for the price and posing as premium.",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background.

No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles.

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

    "title": "Are there modern phones that don't have rounded screen corners while having real hardware improvements?",
    "selftext": "As a long-time Galaxy S22 Ultra user, I am very used to the shape of my screen being a rectangle (curved screen edges aside), and the shift from that shape to having rounded corners for the S25 Ultra (and rumored for the upcoming S26 to be even more curved) has made me hesitate to want to upgrade to that, as my S22's battery gets less and less pleasant to use day to day. I really value being able to see the entirety of any images I'm looking at, and hate the idea of the corners of them being cropped off, or any full-screen videos having bits covered in the corners. I do a lot of reading of image-based content on my phone, and I care about the image quality of it, and it not being cropped.\n\nUnfortunately though, even comparing to the S**25** Ultra doesn't show a huge improvement in many specs besides raw processor performance, especially in terms of things like actual screen resolution, storage/RAM (especially for price), or actual battery *size*. This is quite disheartening for the upgrade path, especially with the screen shape already being a bummer. This has led me to look into alternative phone options outside of the main Galaxy line for once, after being on a \"once every few years\" upgrade path for a while now, but this has been a daunting task.\n\nThe Galaxy Z Fold7 has been slightly tempting, I will say, through both the internal and external screens having roughly that rectangular shape I want, and the folding nature presenting a real feature that I would be gaining. However, the durability concerns, even *less* impressive battery, and also subpar in direct comparison screen resolution aren't drawing me in (though I could be missing other advantages screen wise that aren't as apparent at a glance at a spec sheet - and obviously the internal screen *size* is a plus).\n\nOther than the Fold, I know that some other non-Samsung brands have offerings as well. Huawei has a cool-looking foldable, though a similar deal to the Fold7 (bigger battery at least, though even \\*worse\\* comparison when looking at just one screen versus my S22). ZTE nubia's lineup looks *remarkably* intriguing at a glance I will definitely say, though I feel like I remember looking into them in the past and finding some 'gotcha' that made me not find them to be quite as much of a slam dunk as they seemed - other than the screen resolution somehow STILL not being on the same level as my S22 Ultra. Sharp Aquos also looks solid display shape wise, though the performance and battery options for them aren't as impressive looking with their current lineup. Maybe if an R10 pro.... and then this far into writing this post, I did enough googling rather than just clicking through GSMArena that I realized that that line is asian countries only. Oof. Maybe it'd work anyway if I try hard enough, but tragic. Oh, right, Huawei is in an even worse situation probably. Sigh. The interesting phones are all out of my reach..... ZTE Nubia seems like the one that's actually left that's reasonably purchasable ig? It was the one that looked the best anyway out of them performance-wise (minus gimmicks), so that's not the end of the world, but I'm definitely not immediately sold. I still feel like I haven't found any clear winner. There not being something with no drawbacks is baffling feeling.  \n  \nBut yeah, that's about all I found myself from my searching - lots of things that were sidegrades in many ways, or even occasionally downgrades, while certainly giving me processor upgrades, and a generally mixed bag overall. I like my current screen quite a lot, although I have gained some burn-in from my status bar on the top at this point 😅, and I haven't really felt my processor dragging me back too badly often enough to want to upgrade it at the cost of things I feel I'll notice more often (like the screen or other things I interact with more directly). If it wasn't clear from my not mentioning it until now, I am not a huge camera nerd. Because of that, I don't need the cameras to be the best on the market, as long as they're as usable as my current ones for 'the thing I am looking at looks vaguely like it does irl in this photo' purposes. I am mainly looking to upgrade purely due to battery and connection issues that have grown over time, and am hoping that, after what is approaching 3 or 4 years now, something that would be a truly direct upgrade without compromises would have emerged.\n\n  \n(Hopefully enough of that counts as 'my own analysis' to be allowed under the rules lol 😅)",

I created an app that helps you to keep track of all your data in one simple place.\n\n# Download\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franko.privacyguard)\n\nI first released it 4 years ago, but Google removed it stating it violates the terms of use. Today I relaunched it, and now it complies with the terms.\n\n# What it does\n\nThe app shows all pages in one place, guides you through them and gives you a privacy score.  \n  \nThe app itself does not collect data (the app doesn't have ads or use tracking libraries). You can find its source code here:[ https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App](https://github.com/dtkdt100/Privacy-Guard-App)\n\nIf you are concerned logging in with your user account (although the app is open source and has no server), you can enable that by tapping the three dots at the right corner of the app, then tap \"launch links with browser\".\n\nI would like to hear your feedback!\n\n",

    "title": "Android 16 is still missing native support for priority contacts ringing through Silent Mode",
    "selftext": "How does this functionality gap still exist in Android 16?\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere's no native way to keep your phone in Silent Mode while allowing specific priority contacts to ring through audibly. The only workaround Android offers is Do Not Disturb mode, which is far too aggressive for many users' needs.\n\n**Why DND is not a solution:**\n\n- DND blocks or hides notifications from apps, messages, and other sources\n- Many of us NEED to see notifications throughout the day; we just don't want to hear them\n- DND is designed for complete digital detox, not for \"silent phone with emergency exceptions\"\n- The use cases are fundamentally different\n\n**What users actually need:**\n\nA simple toggle: \"Silent Mode + Priority Contacts Ring Through\"\n\nThis means:\n- Phone is silent for all calls, notifications, and media\n- Visual notifications still appear normally\n- Designated priority contacts bypass silent mode and ring audibly\n- Everything else functions exactly as it does now\n\n**Current \"solution\" is absurd:**\n\nThe commonly suggested workaround is to:\n1. Record 30 seconds of silence as a ringtone\n2. Set that as your default ringtone for everyone\n3. Manually assign audible ringtones to each priority contact\n4. Keep your phone in normal mode pretending to be silent\n\nThis is a ridiculous hack for what should be basic functionality. iOS has had \"Emergency Bypass\" for individual contacts for years. Why is Android forcing users to jump through these hoops?\n\n**Real-world use cases:**\n\n- People who sleep with their phone on silent but need to be reachable for nighttime emergencies\n- Parents who need their kids' schools to reach them immediately\n- On-call professionals who must remain reachable for emergencies\n- Caregivers who need to hear from elderly family members\n- Anyone who wants a quiet phone during work but needs certain people to get through\n\n**Summary:**\n\nSilent Mode and Do Not Disturb serve different purposes. Silent Mode users still want to be connected and informed, just quietly. Forcing us to choose between missing urgent calls or using an overly aggressive DND mode that hides information is a false choice.\n\nThis shouldn't require third-party apps or creative workarounds. It's a fundamental communication feature that's been requested for years.\n\nDoes anyone else agree we need native \"Priority Contacts/Favorites/VIPs Override Silent Mode\" in a future Android update?",

    "selftext": "Hey r/Android 👋,\n\nI've created **WhatsBerry** mainly for r/Blackberry users that wished to use WhatsApp on their no longer supported devices (Android 4.3) by bridging to WhatsApp Web.\n\nToday I just pushed a pretty significant update to **WhatsBerry**, to continue to improve security in **WhatsBerry**, which already used *API key* to authenticate the app itself and *JWT tokens* stored locally on the user device, to protect private endpoints (which need both the API key and JWT).\n\n# What's New\n\nThe big change in v0.10.0-beta is **SMS OTP verification**. Here's how it works now:\n\n1. Scan the QR code and install the app (same as before)\n2. Enter your phone number\n3. Get a one-time code via SMS\n4. Enter the code and you're in\n\nYour device gets remembered, so you only need to do the OTP once per device. After that, it just logs you back in automatically.\n\nIf you try to login with any other device, you will receive a new OTP again. This protects everyone from malicious attempts, since both the **device** and **phone number** have to be verified by the OTP.\n\n# Why?\n\nSecurity. I wanted to make sure each device connecting is actually authorized by the account owner. It also does device fingerprinting (hashed) to keep track of trusted devices with inactivity cleanups every 24hr.\n\n# Still the same WhatsBerry\n\nEverything else works like it did before - real-time messaging, media sharing, group chats, all that good stuff. Audio files still get converted to MP3 automatically for Android 4.3+ compatibility.\n\n# Discord\n\nJoin our discord server to be kept up to date on every update to WhatsBerry: [discord invite](https://discord.gg/MtU7JqrEnW)\n\n# Changelog\n\nYou see the full changelog here: [whatsberry.com/changelog](https://whatsberry.com/changelog)\n\n# Download\n\nYou can download the new version of WhatsBerry here: [whatsberry.com/releases/](https://whatsberry.com/releases/)",

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

Unfortunately, my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip Phone (Model: SM-F731B) has turned into a nightmare.\n\nThis is the second time I have faced a hinge and display crack issue along the fold line. The first time it was repaired under warranty, and now, within months, the same defect has reappeared. The authorized service centre’s report clearly mentioned “Display – step mark on display.”\n\nDespite this being a recurring product defect, Samsung flatly refused to take responsibility or provide meaningful support. Their so-called “flagship quality” completely collapses when it comes to real durability and after-sales service.\n\nI have handled the phone with extreme care — never dropped, always in Samsung’s original case and protector — yet the display failed twice. It’s shocking how a premium device costing nearly ₹1 lakh+ performs worse than a basic mid-range phone.\n\nSamsung promotes innovation and reliability, but my experience has been the opposite — big name, worst quality, and zero accountability.\n\nOnce you face a problem, you’re left completely helpless with scripted replies and no actual resolution.\n\nExtremely disappointing experience for a loyal customer who trusted the brand’s promise of premium quality.\n\nSamsung needs to seriously rethink the build quality of its foldables and the pathetic customer support system behind it.",

I’ve been working on something I’m really excited to share.\n\nYou may have seen the new lockscreen wallpaper effect coming to Pixel phones on Android 16 - where the subject (like a person or pet) pops out from the background. It’s a great feature, but it’s locked to specific devices and Android version.\n\n**I wanted to change that.**\n\nOver the past few weeks, I built **MagicFX Wallpaper**, an app that brings this same intelligent subject isolation effect to **any Android phone running Android 9 or above** — including Samsung Galaxy (OneUI), OnePlus, Xiaomi, Motorola, and more. No hardware limitations, no waiting for OS updates.\n\nDepending on what wallpapers you choose, you may see some really cool Animating effect as well. For example, in my setup the static wallpaper reveals as if a plane is flying in - [https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ\\_0s](https://youtube.com/shorts/I7AOi0XZ_0s)\n\n# What it currently supports:\n\n* Automatically isolates people/pets/objects from any photo\n* Multiple frame styles (oval, square, playful shapes)\n* Full color picker to customize the background\n* Everything processes on your device (no server upload)\n\nIt’s still in early access and I’d love feedback, ideas, and bug reports from the community.\n\nYou can download the App from Google Play Store - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=apps.ijp.magicfx.wallpaper) \n\nThis is just the beginning - I’m actively improving detection quality and adding more frame styles. If you’re into wallpapers, personalization, or just enjoy trying new Android experiments, I’d really appreciate your input.",

    "title": "Android Verified Boot and the Bootloader Unlock Security Theater",
    "selftext": "Over the last few years, there has been an increasing amount of talk about bootloader unlocking, secure / verified boot, apps refusing to run on devices with unlocked bootloaders, and new legislature requiring more secure devices leading to vendors and Google locking even more things down in future phones and Android versions.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that smartphone vendors and Google usually argue that this lockdown is necessary to prevent attackers from just installing any software on the phone and that is just flat out not true, since on PCs and Laptops, we have a working solution for that: UEFI Setup Mode.\n\nWith UEFI, you can put in your own keys during installation and it will use them to verify the boot chain. You are even protected from bricking your own device since you can temporarily turn off Secure Boot to fix issues if you know the UEFI supervisor password.\n\nOn Android, with Android Verified Boot (AVB) 2.0, there are some devices that support adding your own custom keys (via the `avb_custom_key` partition), but lots of devices still don't, and with basically all of them, flashing a broken image with the bootloader locked can get your device bricked.\n\nIf this were better supported, then I think third-party ROMs would have the possibility to be as secure (or more!) as stock in every way, and would enable you to securely use devices for much longer than the vendors usually update them for. Many of us already do this, but we just bite the bullet on the unlocked bootloader, since often there is no better way for now on devices that don't support custom AVB keys.\n\nIn my opinion, much of the currently-discussed lockdown features should even be something that current consumer rights and anti-monopoly laws in e.g. the EU should be able to be applicable to, since lots of third-party ROMs for phones exist, with some being commercial, and part of the current state and the proposed changes make it basically impossible for those to compete on an equal playing ground.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Android device vendors be required to provide a secure way to run third-party operating systems?",

    "selftext": "https://www.amazon.com/ZJKJHJY-Replacement-Charging-Universal-Magnetic/dp/B0DSHYQZX7\n\nWith the dock being $130 and so so speaker ...\nI'd love to make my own dock ...\n\nHow can we get / make a 4 pin pogo charger cable?\n\nCould this or alike be used?\n\nGemini said this \n\nBased on the product details and the specifications of Google Pixel tablets, the 4-pin 7.62mm magnetic charging cable is highly unlikely to work for charging your Google Pixel 11-in tablet from the rear port.\nHere is the reasoning:\nProprietary Connector: While the magnetic connector on the back of a Google Pixel Tablet does use pogo pins (typically 4 pins) and is magnetic, this port is proprietary. It is specifically designed to connect to the Charging Speaker Dock and uses a unique pin configuration and internal circuitry known only to the tablet and the official dock.\nGeneric Specification: The cable you are considering is a generic 7.62mm 4-pin adapter designed for a wide range of small, low-power devices like smart watches, children's bracelets, and specific trackers (as mentioned in the reviews). The fact that the pins may look like they align does not mean the electrical connections (the pinout) will match the tablet's requirements.\nRisk of Damage: Attempting to charge a device with a non-compatible connector, even if it physically aligns, can potentially lead to no charge, slow charge, or in a worst-case scenario, damage to the device's internal charging circuitry.\nFor charging your Google Pixel Tablet, you should rely on the standard USB-C port or the official Google Charging Speaker Dock.\nthe end, your question was: Could this connector be used to charge my Google pixel 11-in tablet from the rear? The pins look like they will work and align",

The second ESIM is configured for all mobile uses - data, SMS, and phone calls - but the first one is just used for SMS messages for certain essential services in my home country.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes I receive calls to my first ESIM (from my home country), and my phone recognizes them as calls from the country to which I immigrated. Today, for example, a spam call came through from a number that I blocked in my home country because my phone thought the call came from the country I currently live in.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's a way to resolve this issue? I would really prefer to avoid paying the cellular provider from my home country anymore money for advanced spam filtering, especially since the calls are supposed to be already blocked by my device.",

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google’s website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google’s support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January — five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2’s stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That’s clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That’s when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn’t an authorized reseller, even though it’s literally listed on Google’s official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google’s warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone’s internal system logs to verify that it hadn’t been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that — the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google’s own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy — it’s unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle’s system says it was bought 5 months earlier → shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn’t been used before purchase → still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

    "selftext": "So like many people, I need to wake up earlier mon-fri for work, and like to sleep in on the weekends. My alarm on the default clock app is set for weekdays only. I used to have bedtime mode set up that it would then on when I plugged my phone in at night (which is when I was going to sleep) and then it would start in bedtime mode until a) my alarm went off or b) I unplugged my phone. This meant on weekends my phone would stay silent until I woke up and unplugged it myself.\nSince I updated my phone this week, bedtime mode will now turn itself off after the alarm time as that is when it says my \"night time\" ends, even if my phone is still plugged in and has not been touched. This means as soon as I get a notification on a weekend morning, I wake up and my precious lie in is ruined.\nAny one else having the same issue and any idea how to fix this? Thanks!",

Screenshots 😂 to name but a few. \n\n\nI literally only want to be able to record phone calls, anyone know how I can do this without rooting? No apps in the app store work because there are restrictions in the newer versions of Android, and this has been the case for some time now. Yes you can get apps, but they don't work well, sometimes not at all. \n\nIs there any way to get call recording WITHOUT rooting? Or is there some method that's maybe a little less full on than rooting that keeps everything else working? \n\nMany thanks in advance 🙏 ",

    "selftext": "Google has been giving me the runaround from a promotion they promised to apply to my order for two months now, and just taking it to the Internet to vent, and shed some negative light on their customer service.\n\nBelow is a recent note I sent after my now (unsuccessful) battle with getting Google Customer Service to honor a discount code:\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nOn August 20, 2025 I placed order GS.xxxxxxxxx (x'd out for privacy) for a Pixel 10 Pro and a Nest Thermostat. The Nest Thermostat had a discount applied since my existing Nest went obsolete\n\nOn August 21, 2025 I received a discount code for \"10% off a purchase.\" Rather than cancel my order which hadn't yet shipped, and replace the order with the discount code, I reached out to customer service to see if they could retroactively apply.\n\nCustomer service told me the following:\n\n11:49:06 AM (me): Ok, so to be clear - once the entire order arrives (the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro), you want me to reach back out to the Google Support chat and share the coupon code, and then you'll apply the code to the order price after it's been delivered?\n11:50:15 AM Robertson: Yes, exactly. that is correct. we are also informed by our support on that (my name), rather than cancelling the order and apply the code, its much more a hassle in our customers end as per our support team\n11:50:42 AM Robertson: no worries once you contacted us back we can consult the case so the code will be applied\n11:52:02 AM (me): Yeah it seems like a pain to cancel / re-order. And can you confirm that the 10% will be applied to both the Nest Thermostat and the Pixel 10 Pro? I did have some rebates / offers on these items that were applied (such as being a Google Fi customer), but wanted to make sure the 10% is still applicable on top of those discounts\n11:54:35 AM Robertson: Oh yes, the 10% discount it will be applicable on top of those discounts (my name) no worries \n\n\nBecause of this, I didn't cancel and replace the order. \n\nHad I done so, I at least would have separated the order into two orders - and gotten the discount on the Nest for one order, and the discount on my phone (an extra $100 off) on the other.\n\nNow after TWO MONTHS of back and forth with customer service, I keep getting told that Google won't apply the discount like the original customer service agent guaranteed me they would. Google has effectively cheated me out of over $100.\n\nAll of their responses ignore the original interaction I had, including the most recent one:\n\nThank you for contacting the Google Support Team regarding your order. We sincerely apologize for the delay in our response and truly appreciate your patience during this review period.\n\nOur specialist team has thoroughly reviewed your request to apply an additional promotional code to your order. We regret to inform you that we cannot accommodate this request.\n\nWe understand this outcome is disappointing, and we want to sincerely apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.\n\nOur higher support team confirmed that a prior promotion—the Nest Learning Thermostat upgrade promotion—was already utilized on the existing order where you wished to apply the new code. As per our terms of service, only one promotional code or discount can be applied per order. This policy prevents us from stacking multiple discounts onto a single purchase.\n\nWe recognize the frustration of not being able to use the additional discount, and we truly apologize for this policy constraint.\n\nIf you have any further questions, or if you need assistance exploring other ways to save on a future purchase, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nThanks!\nCed\nThe Google Support Team\n\n\nThere have been over 20 interactions back and forth, all of them ignore what the first agent told me. Anyone else go through this before?",

    "selftext": "Well, I have been searching for this specific issue all over the internet to see if this is a common issue or not, but I couldn't find anything anywhere, so I guess I was the only lucky guy to experience this.\nA week ago, I was at a Barber 💈 shop with my friend, and I really like to take photos anywhere I go, so we did take some really good pictures for each other using my Pixel 10. I then realized that all the photos I take are in the processing state for too long(never end for first photo), but I didn't think too much, and we keep on taking photos regardless of the last photos being in the processing state. Long story short, after our excellent barber done his job, I took some mirror selfie and would like to post it on my Facebook, but the photos are (still) processing. I then looked at the file names by chance and saw \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxxxx.jpg\" for these photos, oh yeah, may be my photos are so good that tensor G5 needs more time, I wonder. \nBut I really want to upload that mirror selfie on my Facebook, I couldn't wait more. So I did the most dumbest decision, I restarted my phone, just that the processing would start again and fix. But guess what and to my surprise, after restarting the phone, all of these previous \"Pending.PXL_xxxxxx.jpg\" were gone in thin air, I couldn't find it on photos, cloud, not on the trash. I really didn't believe that Google might have that kind of problem, so I waited, I tried taking another photos and these seem to become normal with their processing time being normal (1-3 sec) back again. But yet, the photos at the barber shop never came back. This is just my experience sharing about that and still no hate for Pixel (had been a fan since Nexus), but I think they might include some mitigation for this kind of situation, for example, at least saving the Non- processed photos on device or some kind of fail safe feature. \nBut yeah, this was the only time I've experienced this, and so far it's still working as expected. I hope this doesn't come again. Evidence? No, I really didn't think that kind of thing would ever happen, so no screenshot nor nothing was recorded.\n",

However Google support are stuck in a process loop where they insist that I provide a PDF copy of a repair order, which the company who did the repair cannot provide, as their system does not output PDFs. Additionally I'm being asked to go back to the company repeatedly for this info.\n\nCan anyone help me get this escalated to someone at Google with autonomy to get this resolved? Or does anyone have a contact or someone at Google who monitors reddit who could help?\n\nIn case anyone assumes I'm trying to pull a con on Google - I'd gain nothing here if they RMA as I would like. My device is fairly pristine so Google get that back to repair and then have a refurbed phone, I get a refurbished phone. No gain financially.",

Also, I don't have a 'google authorized' service center in my country. Honestly, this sure looks to me like they got a little too impatient to wait for the planned obsolescense to kick in, and the battery issue was just too easy of an opportunity to force a purchase from a ton of customers, so I'm out. Bye bye, damn shame as I liked your phones, but you are an awful, soulless company anyways, so I'm moving on.\n\nThat said, I'm not one who particularly trusts tech, but I (like all of use) haven't had much choice in going along with the integration of it in our lives, and given the amount of information our devices now carry and as they literally serve as primary sources of identity confirmation, I'm not happy to be pushed to have to switch devices sooner than I'd like. Transferring from the 5 to the 6 was fine; as I recall, a pretty seamless transfer. Going from a Pixel to a different manufacturer? I've not had any experience with that, so I'm hoping to avoid any sort of deluge of idiotic, innane problems like the ones I've seen reported in this sub (locked out of google account etc.).\n\nWhat would be the best manufacturer to graduate to with minimal conflict? I'm not tech-incapable, I simply do not trust the level of intrustion/dependence on it in our lives, and thus things like this make me nervous af. I'd prefer as seamless experience as possible, so any advice or suggestions are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "This kinda like an advise post if you're on the fence about upgrading or just switching brands all together.\n\nI've been with Pixel since the 3XL, upgrading every 2 \nyears or so (8 Pro was my last one), having fun and all that. I got used to the issues in thermals, battery, and bad modems. I accepted it's flaws and moved on, the camera was great so no biggie right.\n\nThen the Pixel 10 impressions started coming in and it was honestly disheartening, I been looking forward to that phone since the early leaks. Overall not a big upgrade, all the same issues, and the GPU performance and drivers situation. Performance just trailing too behind other phones at it's price range. I know I know \"benchmarks aren't everything, optimization is king, you only need that power for gaming and blah blah\". Yeah until your phone has to brute force an unoptimized app (which is common on Android I fear) all Pixel owners I dare you open Best Buy or Amazon and immediately try to scroll, it WILL struggle. \n\nI decided to jump ship and got a One Plus 13, and let me tell you it was night and day. I got the 16 + 512 GB one for 800 (It was a sale + student discount). The performance jump was astronomical, this thing just flies through apps like it's nothing. Gaming of course is also no problem. The battery lasted 8+ hours on 5G (a miracle on pixel if you even get there). Thermal performance is excellent, no more hand warmer when just watching YouTube on wifi or just barely pushing it (Seriously how was that a thing). It truly felt like I had a flaship for real this time. \n\nIs it perfect? nah, Pixel UI is in general better, but not by much, if anything Oxygen OS let's you do things that were taken away, like status bar icons being able to be modified. Tho Pixel UI has one BIG FLAW, the status bar and gesture bar are disgustingly large and DON'T go transparent at all (Shit takes way too much screen real state like wtf). Oxygen OS lets you get rid of the gesture bar completely and it makes the phone feels much more immersive and its a godsend (been wanting this on pixel since the gesture bar was introduced). The camera is worse yes, but not too far behind either, I don't think too many pics so I was ok with this compromise. I don't care, and barely used, any of the AI features so it wasn't a big loss either.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the happiest I've been with a phone ever, don't be afraid to look outside of your pixel bubble if you feel like you're not getting what you paid for.

Since I wearing aids it was pretty important that that worked for me, and it didn't.  I then moved to Samsung and have been with them ever since. \n\nRecently AT&T offered a \"get a pixel 10 pro XL for free with a trade-in of any pixel\" and I still had my pixel 6 pro so I decided to give it another try. Here's why I ended up sending it back...\n\n1.  I don't know if this is a move your data from Samsung to pixel problem but when I moved my data over to the pixel 10 pro none of my apps would send notifications. Google support was unhelpful and after a factory reset didn't resolve it they basically told me to turn it in for another phone, which I did. I got the second phone and has the same problem. I ended up figuring out that if I went into each app and deleted the cache and the data then the notifications would start working again. Since I have 250 plus apps that wasn't a very good solution. \n\n2.  I had heard that the pixel phones had a really bad scrolling experience, but I don't remember it when I had pixel phones. Coming from the Samsung it was blatantly obvious that scrolling on the pixel was awful. I did check some of the solutions to resolve this and none of them really made it much better.\n\n3.  The final straw was Bluetooth switching.  My Samsung phones prioritize the newest connection, which is super important to me. I go from my hearing aids to the car when I get into it, and when I leave the car it goes back to my hearing aids. When I  turn on my Bluetooth headphones the phone picks them and when I turn them off it goes back to my hearing aids. With the pixel none of that happened. When I got in the car I had had to actually select the car Bluetooth for the pixel to use it. When I turned on my Bluetooth headphones I had to actually select them for the pixel to use them. Needless to say that was a major irritation and that's when I decided the pixel was going back.",

    "selftext": "Google Case no.: 4-1941000040097 & 4-4312000039720\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with how Google Support has handled my Pixel 7 battery swelling issue. My phone’s battery expanded, pushing up the screen — a clear hardware defect that many Pixel 7 users have reported.\n\nAfter multiple emails and days of waiting, Google Support said they would refund the amount only the battery replacement if done through their authorized service partner CTDI (Aperia Mall, Singapore), but not other parts.\n\nFinally, I had no choice but to accept the change of battery only, since my screen was still working. I brought my device to Google’s authorized service partner, CTDI. However, to my horror they refused to replace just the battery and insisted that it is a policy I must also replace the screen, the LCD cost about SGD 200++— even though the swelling itself caused the damage.\n\nThis feels like an outright scam or cost-shifting tactic — forcing customers to pay for screen replacement that resulted from a known manufacturing defect. Google should take full responsibility instead of making users pay for damage caused by their own hardware fault.\n\nI’m without a working device for 5days+, and Google took their time to get back to me despite countless chasers, the lack of urgency is very disappointing.\n\nAt the end of the day,\n\nI made wasted trips down to service center (wasted time and transport fare) Unnecessary aggravation - service center insist I needed to change both screen + battery. Still without a functioning phone after 6 days+ Service Partner, CTDI, did sense my frustration and took my phone in to escalate to Google, However this would be at least a 3 business days process (with no guarantee) + 2 days of weekend.\n\nHas anyone else faced this issue recently?\n\nDid Google cover both the battery and screen replacement for you?\n\nIf you’re facing the same problem, please make your voice heard. The more of us report it, the harder it’ll be for Google to ignore this widespread defect",

It was initially covered under warranty for that issue, but they said the USB-C port was also damaged, so I had to pay £200 to get it fixed.\n\n\n\nI paid, and they repaired the screen, but now the phone keeps restarting every five minutes, making it basically unusable.\n\n\n\nI contacted Google Support, but they told me that since the screen was repaired and I don’t have proof that the restarting is related to the previous repair, I’d have to send it in again and pay for another repair.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?

    "selftext": "I am absolutely stunned and disgusted by how Google Support has handled my Pixel 6a case. After over 100 days of waiting, following up, and sending every bit of proof they asked for, I finally received a response — and it’s nothing short of insulting.\n\nThey claim my Pixel 6a is “not eligible” for the battery performance program and that their decision “stands firm.”\nTheir reasoning? Because my phone received the OTA update, they believe it’s safe to use.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear: my Pixel 6a’s battery is swollen.\nThe back panel is literally lifting, and the phone looks like it could burst at any moment.\nYet Google Support — a trillion-dollar company — tells me it’s “safe” simply because of a software patch.\n\nThis isn’t just negligence. It feels like a deliberate attempt to gaslight affected customers.\n\nEven worse, Google’s own appeasement program page says the appeasement app disables affected phones after identifying the fault — since they’re unsafe to use.\nBut the support agent told me the exact opposite: that my phone is not affected because it got the OTA that supposedly “makes it safe.”\n\nSo which is it? Because right now, it feels like a scam tactic to deny legitimate claims while pretending the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nMy battery life has been destroyed since that update — it barely lasts an hour now, runs hot, and is clearly unstable.\nIf this is what Google calls safe, they’ve lost touch with reality and consumer safety.\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint — it’s a warning to other Pixel users.\nDon’t let them silence you with scripted replies and fake “OTA fixes.”\nMy case proves they are ignoring real safety hazards and denying rightful appeasements with deceptive reasoning.\n\nGoogle, you’ve had 100+ days to do the right thing.\nInstead, you chose to insult your customers’ intelligence and risk their safety.",

I feel that the Pixel is smoother, maybe due to the absence of the horrid Liquid Glass animations; I feel the transaction between different apps more seamless. \n\nHowever there is a single instance in which the iPhone, for my taste, is incredibly superior (except for battery and integration across devices): the quality of the display. The colours of the iPhone are brighter and gorgeous, and at the same level of brightness setting, the Pixel has a darker display, with way less brilliant colours.\n\nDo you feel the same? ",

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google’s website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google’s support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January — five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2’s stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That’s clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That’s when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn’t an authorized reseller, even though it’s literally listed on Google’s official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google’s warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone’s internal system logs to verify that it hadn’t been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that — the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google’s own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy — it’s unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle’s system says it was bought 5 months earlier → shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn’t been used before purchase → still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

    "selftext": "Got the Pixel 10 Pro on launch, and since then it is impossible to get notifications on time. I have Google Home with camera notifications and cradlewise for baby notifications and all the notifications are delayed. Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

    "selftext": "I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google’s website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. \nThe phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.\n\nWhen I checked the warranty on Google’s support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January — five months before I actually bought it.\nThe warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.\n\nAfter some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2’s stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That’s clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.\n\nSo I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That’s when the nightmare started.\n\nThey told me O2 isn’t an authorized reseller, even though it’s literally listed on Google’s official site.\n\nO2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google’s warranty system.\n\nWhen I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.\n\nAt one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone’s internal system logs to verify that it hadn’t been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that — the phone was first activated after my purchase date.\nAnd even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.\n\nEvery agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. \nUnder both EU law and Google’s own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy — it’s unacceptable.\n\nThis whole experience has been absurd.\n\nTL;DR:\nBought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).\nGoogle’s system says it was bought 5 months earlier → shortened warranty.\nGoogle checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn’t been used before purchase → still refused to fix the warranty.\nSupport keeps giving false info and closing the case.\n\nHas anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",

Often I would unlock the phone and see a flurry of notifications from Google Home about camera activity popping up. Funny enough, these notifications are not time stamped to when the phone was unlocked, but when the event happened. So it is super common for a Google Home notification to pop up with 30 mins ago written on it. Same happens with other apps too. \n\nI have turned off the adaptive battery, have the Google Home and other apps allowed unrestricted access to battery, but nothing seems to work. I had a Pixel 8a and a Pixel 7 before this and never had the issue on them. \n\nNot sure if it is a faulty device or a software bug. ",

I - surprisingly to myself- even love the assistant, and use it a heck of a lot. \n\nBut I don't know if I can do it again.\n\nMy 7pro has been rife with issues since the beginning; overheating, battery problems, sluggish OS and more. And while I recognize that this is now an older phone, what's the point of all these years of software updates if the phone itself goes caput after three? \n\nI'm looking at the 10 pro, and in my heart, it's the logical choice. It's the time to upgrade. But my heart is just not in it. \n\n(The alternative is (ugh) the iPhone 17 pro max- I work in creative media/content, and have a MacBook that I use daily, so moving to the eco system makes sensez I guess?)\n\nGet me excited about this new 10 pro. Convinced me it's gonna be a different experience, because my heart can't take another disappointment like the 7pro.\n\nHelp me, r/googlepixel, you're my only hope.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "title": "My Unlocked S25 Ultra from BestBuy Disabled After 6 Months",
    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’d like to take a moment to make a public service announcement for anyone contemplating a switch from Samsung or Android to the iPhone. It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

    "title": "Open Letter to Samsung CEO TM Roh: Immediately Replace the Camera Division Head to Salvage Galaxy's Imaging Reputation",
    "selftext": "Dear Mr. TM Roh,\n\nAs long-time consumers of Samsung products, we must express our profound disappointment with the continuous deterioration of the camera experience in the Galaxy series. The current leadership of the camera division has severely failed in its duties. Without immediate action, Samsung's reputation in mobile imaging will be irreparably damaged. Below are eight compelling reasons why the head of the camera division must be replaced:\n\n1. Deceptive Marketing and Exaggerated Claims\n\nClaims of \"industry-leading camera performance\" in promotional events, while actual results fall far short\nSignificant discrepancies between sample images and real-world performance, bordering on false advertising\n\n2. Technological Backwardness, Outpaced by Competitors\n\nPersistent image quality issues: excessive noise in shadows, crushed blacks in HDR, poor telephoto quality, subpar night photography, unnatural portrait details and bokeh\nFundamental flaws: shutter lag (over 0.5 seconds), excessive video sharpening\nLeft behind by competitors like iPhone, vivo, OPPO, Huawei, and Xiaomi\n\n3. Neglecting User Feedback, Ignoring Longstanding Issues\n\nYears of user complaints (e.g., poor shadow detail, unnatural skin tones, shutter delay) remain unresolved\nWidespread criticism in official forums, social media, and professional reviews—yet Samsung turns a blind eye\n\n4. Blindly Copying Apple, Losing Samsung's Identity\n\nFrom hardware tuning to software algorithms, mindlessly following Apple's \"natural tone\" approach, resulting in dull, lifeless photos\nEven replicating Apple's flaws (e.g., HDR black crush, excessive sharpening), completely abandoning Samsung's once-vibrant signature style\n\n5. Discriminatory Skin Tone Processing\n\nPoor rendering of Asian and Caucasian skin tones, often appearing unnaturally \"yellow-black\"\nMocked by users as the \"Samsung Yellow Face Filter\"\nFar inferior to Chinese brands (e.g., OPPO, vivo) in natural skin tone optimization\n\n6. Complacency in Hardware, Refusing to Innovate\n\nStubbornly using outdated sensors (e.g., HP2 and IMX754 for four consecutive years), refusing to upgrade to larger sensors\nUnwilling to learn from Chinese brands' advanced hardware and software technologies\n\n7. Slow and Discriminatory Software Updates\n\nCamera algorithm updates are infrequent and sluggish in addressing issues\nDeliberately withholding improvements from older models (e.g., Galaxy S23 and S24 series still lack optimizations from the S25)\n\n8. Technologically Conservative, Resisting AI Innovation\n\nOutdated noise reduction in primary and telephoto cameras, leading to smeary night shots\nRefusal to adopt AI computational photography (e.g., Google's HDR+, Huawei's XMAGE engine)\n\nOur Demands\n\n1. Immediately remove the head of the camera division and recruit experts with genuine expertise in computational photography and user experience.\n2. Significantly upgrade hardware: Adopt cutting-edge sensors, larger apertures, 200MP telephoto lenses, and variable aperture technology.\n3. Completely overhaul software optimization: Accelerate update cycles, fix legacy issues, and ensure older models receive algorithm improvements.\n4. Establish a rapid user feedback response system to prevent years of unresolved complaints.\n\nSamsung was once a leader in mobile imaging—now, due to the incompetence of its camera team, it has become a laughingstock. If decisive action is not taken now, Galaxy users will flock to competitors like iPhone, Huawei, and Xiaomi. Time is running out. Act now!\n\n— Frustrated Samsung Consumers",

    "selftext": "My experience with [samsung.com](http://samsung.com/) was awful. I preordered the Z Flip 7 the 20th of july, while there was the promotion of the free galaxy buds pro 3 while giving my Z Flip 6 for trade in, so i ended up paying around 380€ for the phone, earbuds and galaxy Watch 8 Classic.\n\nIt's been a month and a half, the site said it would've been sent by the 4th of August but still my order is \"pending\" on their site with no update since they got my money on july 20th. I've bene texting and calling them since August 1st and they told me to \"wait\". The 11 of August they've opened a ticket, but i've messaged them 3 times since then and they told me that they will contact me when they have news.\n\nIt's now Sept 4 and i still haven't got anything from them. Now the promotion for the buds 3 pro has ended, so effectively i can't even get the free buds out of my promotion. I find it absurd and ridiculous that a company like Samsung has this kind of shopping and customer service issues.\n\nI wanted to share my experience and advice you to not get anything, at least from their official site.",

    "selftext": "A short story on how terrible Samsung CS is, it's like they are running on some KPI that's anything but customer satisfaction it feels like.\n\nBasically I put an initial order of a Fold7 only to realize that I want to get the VIP Advantage to get the Samsung Care+ for 2 years, for 4 devices. So I reached out to the customer support saying if I can get a refund for the restocking fee (worth $55) because I won't even open the initial order Fold7 box, it'll stay sealed.\n\nLie #1: the customer support agent said, sure, we'll refund the restocking fee once we received the return, just reach out to us again. Return was received by Samsung, reached out to their CS and got a confirmation the restocking fee will get refunded in a few days to my account. The next day got an email from Samsung CS that the refund cannot be done because some backend limitation yadda yadda.\n\nHad a chat with them again, asking what happened to the promised refund, same excuse, can't be done. Mind you this was after they promised me that they'll refund the restocking fee after the return has been received. Then they offer a $75 store credit, to which I accepted.\n\nLie #2: The $75 apparently was a lie as well. The next day after I was promised the store credit, I got another email saying that they can't $75 store because of the process, etc. Instead, they want to give $10.\n\nNow, probably I should've chalked this out and move on, surely my time is worth than $55. But this doesn't feel right, and now I'm actually calling them trying to get to a supervisor, because why not.\n\nMoral of the story: don't trust the promises of a Samsung CS. They'll screw you over if they can.\n\nUpdate (9/2/2025): I just got the $75 store credit after the supervisor I talked to reescalated the issue internally. While this wasn't the original restocking fee refund that they promised, this is acceptable. I just wish that the process to get them fulfill their promise isn't as painful as the one I just went through.",

I recently upgraded from a Sony x900e & Vizio m51a-h6, to a Samsung s90f & q990f, and I’m absolutely blown away by sound & video quality. The colors are insanely vivid and watching shows with direct sunlight in the frame actually makes me squint my eyes it so bright & feels like I’m there. Part of me wishes I would have splurged for s95f, but I’m still insanely happy with the s90f. The q990f does an amazing job for a soundbar setup. I was an earlier adopter of Dolby Atmos back in like 2016 with a $5k pioneer elite home theater system that I unfortunately had to get rid of when I transitioned to apartment living. Don’t get me wrong, this sound bar isn’t quite on the same level as my old system was, but it’s probably about as close as I could imagine a soundbar system being able to get. Between the new tv & the new sound bar, the immersion is so much more profound when watching shows & movies.\n\nFor anyone who’s considering getting either of those, this guy says go for it. The only way I could see getting a better experience is paying a considerable amount more money. ",

    "title": "Terrible Experience with Samsung Care Plus / Servify",
    "selftext": "This is more of a PSA for other users and Galaxy owners than anything else, which echoes some of the posts on this topic, but hopefully may be useful for someone else in the future, especially if you're considering this insurance plan based on the idea you will get a replacement within a business day. The TLDR for this is: if you are considering getting Samsung Care Plus/Servify, don't. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the whole story for those interested:\n\nI have a Galaxy S24 that recently died as a result of water damage and I am enrolled with Samsung Care Plus, which is administered through Servify. The plan I'm on specifically advertises same or next business day replacement of your phone in the event of loss, theft, or, as is my case, complete mechanical failure from accidental handling. When I went to actually make a claim though, it's become increasingly apparent I am not going to get anything close to the \"hassle-free\" same/next day replacement I was hoping for.\n\nIt starts with trying to even find where to file a claim. I first went to the FAQ page on the Samsung website as that's the first result when you simply google search \"Samsung Care Plus\". That FAQ has a question that asks, \"How do I file a claim?\" and provides a link, except following that link brings you to a \"404 Oh No! Page Not Found\" page. \n\nOkay, that's weird and a bad start, but let's try another question in the FAQ on Samsung's own website for this program. Another question on there asks, \"How can I access 24/7 Expert Support for my Samsung device?\" and notes there is 24/7 support at all times. So I call the number and... get a voicemail basically letting me know that their phone support is actually more like 12/7 as it's only open from 7 am to 7 pm CST.\n\nNow I'm kind of frustrated, but let's try searching in Google again. I am admittedly bad at doing this so this is more my fault than anyone else's but, if you're like me, maybe this post will save you a step. So I search again and come to what looks like a Samsung Care Plus page. It has the logo at the top along with \"Assurant\". At this point in my journey, I don't know anything other than I have Samsung Care Plus as my phone insurance and don't realize Samsung Care Plus has multiple versions administered by different insurance companies. It looks like we're almost in business here but when I go to put in my phone number, I get an error saying I don't have a plan. Yikes!\n\nI'm in a panic now as I think that maybe I'm misremembering things and didn't actually sign up properly for insurance. I dig into my emails (which maybe should have been the first thing I tried in hindsight) and found a link to a claim page for my plan from the original email with my plan information. This is successful! But then, when actually filing a claim, I get a notification indicating that Samsung/Servify don't have my phone in stock. Impossible, I think, as this phone is literally one cycle behind brand new. I would understand if I had a 10 year old phone that's out of the manufacturer's warranty. But this phone (a Galaxy S24) is less than 24 months old. \n\nSo what options do I have? Well, the claim page indicated that I can follow through with a claim, but that I may not get a replacement phone for 2-3 weeks. This is a far cry from \"same or next business day\". Weirdly as well, the claim page requires you to affirm that you've removed the device lock on your phone, something that is impossible to do given my phone won't even turn on.\n\nI use my phone for work so I need a working phone Monday to Friday. I can maybe get away with one day of being unavailable, but anything beyond that is problematic. I got this Care+/Servify plan after my last phone was damaged beyond repair and needed to be fully replaced as well. Back then I was on a plan with Verizon/Asurion and ran into the exact same problem with Asurion indicating they didn't have replacement phones for an S22. But at least with Verizon/Asurion, when I escalated the issue to a supervisor and indicated I needed a new phone immediately for work, they sent a new phone the next business day (and upgraded me to a S23 due to their failure to have the necessary phone in stock). Nevertheless, I switched from Verizon's insurance to Samsung's insurance under the assumption that since this is a plan offered directly by Samsung, I wouldn't have to deal with the hassle of being on the phone for hours and having to beg a supervisor to help me just to get the coverage that is advertised and that I have been paying for monthly. I thought, \"Surely Samsung would have their own phones in stock for their own insurance plan.\" I am apparently wrong.\n\nIn contrast to my Verizon/Asurion experience, when I called Servify and indicated I use my phone for work and need a new phone asap, two service reps hung up on me. On my 3rd call, I tried to escalate to a supervisor and the service rep... hung up on me again. On my 4th call, I told the service rep I needed a replacement and would accept a downgrade to an S23 or S22 (I really don't care what phone I get. I just need a phone). She stayed on the line with me and seemed to genuinely be trying to help, but then told me that they also don't have S23s or S22s in stock. Admittedly frustrated, I asked, \"Do you have any phone in stock?\" She then also hung up on me. On my 5th and final call, I again requested a supervisor or for the matter to be escalated. The service rep indicated his supervisor was busy but could get on the phone \"shortly\". I was then put on a wait line, which I stayed in like an idiot for an hour before realizing the service rep was probably on the other side laughing at me for being an idiot. The end result here is that I have still been on the phone for hours, but I definitely do not have a replacement phone incoming from Servify at this time.\n\nSo, what have I learned:\n\n1. There's apparently multiple versions of Samsung Care Plus. Samsung has invested enough resources to make a web page, but not enough to audit the links in its own FAQ.\n\n2. You will likely not receive a same or next business day replacement for a phone, even when that phone is still within the manufacturer's warranty period.\n\n3. Samsung/Servify customer service will hang up on you almost immediately if they get a whiff of you wanting a replacement phone (even when offering to take a downgrade or different phone as substitution) after filing a claim, or if you indicate you want to escalate the issue to a supervisor.\n\n4. Carrier insurance is likely the better option still for phone insurance needs if you need a phone replaced asap.\n\nI think this is all the more disappointing in light of my friends' experiences with Apple Care. They seem to be able to actually get a replacement device on time and without a hassle. I don't want an iPhone. I've never wanted an iPhone. But god damn, at least Apple seems to get the customer service aspect of this whole thing and it does make me a tinge jealous that we're instead left with this second rate, broken mess of a system on the Samsung side. Apple also seems to understand that even if some other company is underwriting the insurance, the customer only ever wants to interface with Apple. I'm not sure how Samsung hasn't figured this out yet.\n\nWhat am I going to do? Well, I need my phone for work so I'm going to go in to Verizon and just buy a new phone and eat the cost. Whenever Servify grants me the privilege of sending me a new phone, I'll sell that one and use it to offset the cost of my new phone. And I will be canceling my Care+/Servify insurance and switching back to Verizon/Asurion. They were a hassle to deal with, but at least ended up getting me a phone within a business day when I needed it. Finally, I'll be filing a complaint with the BBB (for whatever that's worth, I guess).\n\n  \nHopefully this helps any folks considering Samsung Care Plus. I'd also be curious if other folks have had the same or different experiences in comparison to me.",

    "selftext": "Hello to those who end up reading this! \n\nI was invited to Gamescom by Samsung for their PlayGalaxy event in Cologne. \n\nI was able to wander around Gamescom and look at all the Samsung tech like their Folding devices, monitors, Ultra tablets and their Premier 5 projector. \n\nI got to sit and listen to a forum by Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm which was really cool.\n\nThey went over things like migrating Android over to the Vulkan rendering API and how that improved performance on Galaxy devices.\n\nThey showed performance graphs for some of the popular gacha games and we got hands on with these devices. \n\nHowever the thing that impressed me the most, was the thing i least expected. \n\nThat product was the Samsung Odyssey 3D. \n\nYou're able to play games in 3D without glasses.\n\nI spoke to others at the event and they all agreed that this was the standout of the show. \n\nThe monitors are 4k, 165hz and 27 inches. \n\nThis product really shocked me with how well the 3D works. \n\nI think the reason for this is due to the fact it uses eye tracking to keep the 3D looking its best at all times, I'm not sure what eye tracking technology is being used as I was unable to get an answer. \n\nI was able to play Stellar Blade, and at first I was super skeptical but the moment I sat in front of it I had the biggest grin on my face. \n\nThis tech does not come across well in videos, you really have to experience it to believe it, I got some of the others to give it a go and everyone had the same reaction. \n\nMy main complaint is that I'd like the monitor in a larger size, and preferably in ultrawide OLED, but those are requirements for any monitor I look at. \n\nIf you get a chance to check it out in store, I'd absolutely recommend it, there's nothing like it. \n\n[Gaming in 3D](https://www.imgur.com/a/itOl8xK)",

I eventually switched to iPhone with the 12 Pro, and 5 years later it still feels just as smooth as the day I got it.\n\nNow I’m considering going back to Android with the S26, but I don’t want to deal with the same old performance issues if Samsung hasn’t really fixed this.\n\nFor those of you who’ve stuck with Samsung in recent years, how does long-term performance hold up? Are they still prone to slowing down or is it finally on par with iOS for longevity?",

But I have my issues too.\n\nFor one, the screen is nowhere near as bright as it should be when I'm outside. I look at it and it makes me a little frustrated sometimes when I can't see it that good.\n\nAt least on my unit, and I haven't heard any other reports, but the hinge has been making a cracking noise when I open and close it.\n\nThe cellular signal seems worse for some odd reason on my Flip7 over the Fold7, and somebody else said the same thing on X (Twitter).\n\nI'm still annoyed I can't zoom in and get better quality. There's no telephoto.\n\nAlong with some other issues, it's over 1,000 bucks now. So while I like the phone and I'd recommend it for someone that specifically wants a flip phone, especially since they might not notice these other issues like me (I'm thinking more normal people who aren't into phones like that) Samsung has a lot of work to do. We're getting there with things like the MUCH improved cover screen. Man, I love that cover screen so much. But we have a longer journey to go. I'll be back on my Fold7 now.",

I absolutely love it, i put it on the wall and its nicely up there.\n\nMy only concern is, the 2 top screws only screwed in a few turns before becoming tight. No cross thread as I pulled it out and did it again on both 2 or 3 times to be certain.\n\nHas anyone else found that the thread depth isn't very deep on the top 2 screws for mounting?\n\nConsidering taking it down and quadruple checking but wanting to leave it.\n\nIts been 24 hours now, no movement so want to leave it on the wall but the anxiety in the back of my mind tells me otherwise. I fear ill keep going in circles and eventually ruin it myself.\n\nMake me feel better please haha.\n\n❤️",

Going from Android 12 to 16 means quite a lot of new things to learn.

Anyone have experience with both phones, any preference between the two?

Looking to keep one of these devices for a minimum 8 years or so. (Bought both technically \"used\" price difference between the two was only $80 more on s24 ultra)",

    "selftext": "As the title suggest i wanted to give my views after using the s25 edge for a month. Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "I bought the Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra when it first launched, and it’s honestly one of my favorite tech purchases. I even got the keyboard case with it, which basically turned it into a thin laptop for me. It handles light web browsing with no issues, but where it really shines is media — watching YouTube and movies on that massive screen is like carrying a portable theater anywhere: on a plane, train, or even in the library when I get bored.\n\nOver time, I’ve ended up using it for my classes too, and this is where I think the Tab has made the biggest impact for me. Samsung Notes + split screen is a killer combo. I can have my textbook open on one side and my notes on the other, and everything stays perfectly synced with my S24 Ultra. Organizing and editing notes feels effortless, and honestly, this might be the tool that helps me graduate.\n\nI liked it so much that when I bought my brother a tablet, I went with the S9 Ultra for him (though no keyboard case). I actually tried the 12.9” iPad Pro before that, but I couldn’t get past the aspect ratio, and iPadOS just felt like it was holding the hardware back. I ended up returning it pretty quickly.\n\nEven now, the S8U is still going strong, and I don’t see myself upgrading unless Samsung makes something even bigger — like 18”. As long as it still fits in a backpack, I’d be all in for the biggest screen possible.\n\nOne drawback, though: there’s still no good geometric drawing app for things like **Smith chart calculations** (sorry for the PTSD, fellow engineers 😅). That’s literally one of the only reasons I still carry a pencil and a small geometric instrument box in my bag.\n\nAnd finally, one feature I really wish they’d add is a **display-in port**. Being able to plug in my PS5 and use the S8U as a monitor on long trips would be a dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xfknygkuqf1.jpg?width=4208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1834ddf117cc4a694d07a8d4bac9d8ecc0271b55\n\n",

How do they compare for battery life, heat, camera performance (low light, telephoto, autofocus), and overall smoothness? Does the missing Bluetooth on the S25 Ultra’s S Pen make any difference in real use? And which one feels like it will age better over the long term with updates and durability?\n\nWould love to hear real-life impressions from anyone who’s been using either of them.",

    "selftext": "When I initially ordered the unlocked S25 Ultra for pickup from Best Buy online, I ordered it with a trade in included. However, I was unable to trade it in because I didn't have my ID with me, so they had to cancel it when I went there to pick up the phone. Therefore, I did not get any price deduction from the trade-in, as it was cancelled. \n\nExactly 6 months after the day of my pickup, my phone is locked out. This happened right after I factory reset my phone, but it is not FRP from Google (I explained I got through the setup and was immediately locked out to Samsung support, but they said that did not have anything to do with the lock). I looked up what the lock screen looks like, and it seems like it was a Knox Guard lock done by Samsung. I searched around for a bit and realized that it might be due to Samsung thinking I failed to trade in the phone and locking it, even though they cancelled the trade-in in the first place. I called Samsung support from the limited Knox Guard menu, and they said it was something Best Buy had to deal with. I went to Best Buy, and they couldn't do anything either, as they weren't trained for these things (I also had full proof of my email receipt and the order on the Best Buy app). They told me to reactivate my service on my other phone to contact 1-888-BESTBUY, but I can't since I am not the owner of the Verizon account, I can't do that for a while. I contacted Best Buy live chat as well yesterday, and sent an email to the trade-in Best Buy email about the situation, including order details, proof of purchase, and IMEI, like they told me to. However, I received this email: \"This issue is unrelated to Best Buy’s Trade-in program, which does not have the ability to lock devices. We cannot assist. Please work with Samsung and your wireless service provider to resolve your issue.\" What am I supposed to do then? Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do? Knox guard states that \"This device is disabled because it was reported as lost, stolen, or has a balance due for failure to meet trade-in terms\". I do not think it was reported as lost or stolen because I literally have the Google and Samsung accounts that were on my phone on the computer with passkeys, and I literally logged back into the exact same accounts during setup, and also it's not like I was in an unfamiliar location (I was in my dorm). Do you guys have any idea how I could resolve this issue? ",

It’s crucial to note that many influencers tend to gloss over significant drawbacks when comparing these devices.\n\nHaving spent my entire life as a loyal Samsung user, I decided to make the leap to the iPhone, enticed by its renowned camera and impressive image processing capabilities that many rave about. So, I partook in the heart-wrenching decision to trade in my trusty Galaxy S21 for the sleek and shiny iPhone 16 Pro Max. However, from the very first day of ownership, I found myself wishing I could turn back time. The unexpected challenges I faced left me disheartened. Here are some of the hurdles I encountered:\n\n**Clipboard Limitations**: Unlike Android, you can only copy one item at a time—any hope for a multi-copy functionality is dashed.\n\n**App Management Woes**: There’s no convenient option to close all apps simultaneously. Instead, you must agonizingly close each one, one at a time.\n\n**Absent Split-Screen Support**: I found myself frustrated by the lack of split-screen functionality, a feature I had come to rely on.\n\n**Long Screenshots**: Capturing long screenshots is an impossibility here, denying me the ability to document lengthy conversations or articles.\n\n**Custom Ringtones**: The process for setting custom ringtones is a hassle, requiring a separate app—goodbye to the era of effortless personalization.\n\n**Restarting the Device**: Restarting the phone is more complex than it should be; it’s not as simple as turning it off. It involves a cryptic code buried deep in Apple forums (Volume Up, release; Volume Down, release; hold Power)—how puzzling!\n\n**Volume Control Limitations**: Adjusting volume settings for media, notifications, and calls separately feels like a relic of the past, as you can’t do this in the drop-down menu.\n\n**Navigational Frustrations**: There’s no universal back button or gesture; swiping left to right often leads to a dead end rather than back to the original page, especially in apps like YouTube.\n\n**Screen Rotation Challenges**: Want to watch a video in landscape mode? You’ll need to disable the rotation lock, orient the phone, and then re-enable it. On Android, a simple button suffices—how convenient that was!\n\n**Pro Camera Controls**: The pro camera controls that I had come to love are nonexistent, leaving me longing for the options I once had.\n\n**RAW Images**: Even when shooting in RAW format, the images still undergo processing, stripping away the purity I expected.\n\n**File Transfer Hassles**: Transferring files to my computer is a complete chore—no direct transfer without relying on iTunes or other cumbersome software.\n\n**Notification Clearing Issues**: Clearing all notifications? It still doesn’t erase the recent ones. It’s both baffling and irritating.\n\n**Inadequate Maps**: Apple Maps leaves much to be desired; navigating to stores and restaurants can be a frustrating quest due to the lack of reliable first-party ratings.\n\n**Missing Video Wallpapers**: The absence of video wallpapers feels like a creative limitation, denying the opportunity to personalize my home screen vibrantly.\n\n**Keyboard Design Flaw**: There’s no number row on the main keyboard page. For a device that prides itself on seamlessness, this feels like an oversight.\n\n**Siri's Limitations**: Despite the hype, Siri falls short compared to alternatives like Gemini or Copilot, offering less efficient assistance.\n\n**Alarm Confusion**: Setting alarms doesn’t even tell you how many hours are left before they go off, leaving you in the dark until the moment arrives.\n\nOn a brighter note, fortunately, I opted for the early upgrade plan, which means I’ll be trading this device in as soon as possible. I truly hope this account helps others to make a well-informed purchasing decision.",

Btw the objective was to see which Magic Eraser works better. Although Samsungs eraser was sooo much better... but on a different picture. Because my camera couldn't capture one vehicle in the background clearly.\n\nI do have Quick Tap Shutter on and Prioritize Focus over speed off. I thought Samsung could do better because it's pretty much iPhone 15 or 16 equivalent. Idk I thought camera was kinda close to iPhone but phone camers, i think iPhone wins hands down.",

Before that I was daily driving s25 plus but decided to switch cuz i really wanted to try the edge and its slim form factor. Also i got it for €500 which made it worth.\n\nThis phone is crazy underrated, you really need to hold it to appreciate the way it feels. Using it just feels nice and easy due to being light, also when carrying it my pocket. \n\nOther than its thinness its also surprisingly decent when it comes to heat. Even with the snapdragon elite the phone only ever gets warm and cools down pretty quickly afterwards. \n\nThe biggest issue people have with the phone is the battery. With only 3900Mah i didnt have much expectations for it but after using it for a month i can say this: is it great? No, but is it dogshite? Nope, its decent and gets me through a whole day. \nA typical day for me starts at 6 am and goes on until 10 in the evening, i usually have around 20% left with 5 hours of screen on time. \nTo achieve this i use AOD smart, turned off QHD and 5G and limited perfomance to \"light\". Few  days ago i had a lazy off day where i spend most of my day inside, i reached 8 hours of web browsing using samsung internet.\n\nIn the end i found the edge to be more fun to use than the + and due to its thinness and weight it is also easier to handle and doesn´t really have a lot of downsides beside the camera and price. \n\nIf you are one of the people who were on the fence about buying the phone, I can´t reccomend it enough and will be using it as my main device for a good while. Though i also suggest waiting for a sale as i cant justify the price it started with.",

    "selftext": "Basically I wrecked my iPhone 16 Plus by installing iOS 26. Lag, overheating, notifications stopped working, navigation failed (GPS, not UI), not to mention it's ugly as hell. Since I couldn't live with it and couldn't fix it, I went and bought myself an Android phone. \n\nThe S25 Edge had me the moment I took it out of the box. Love the thinness. And the weight. It's crazy how good it feels to use. The battery is holding up pretty well given what it is, but I'm one of those weirdos that prioritizes battery and cooling over performance. So I'm in light profile, 60hz, no AOD, lowest screen resolution. Battery is doing ok. I've got 5 hours right now on 43% battery usage and that includes 4 system updates to get current (which means 4 reboots), updating Google and Samsung apps and then installing all the apps I use, signing in to everything, downloading ringtones and text tones, organizing quick panels, installing Good Lock and doing some customizing, playing a couple games, watching TikTok and YouTube, on and on and on. \n\nSo...the phone is solid for how I use it. On paper it looks bad with that 3,900 mah battery capacity, but day one is looking just fine to me. I'm sure the battery will only get better as the phone learns my usage patterns. \n\nIf you're still on the fence about the Edge, go get one in hand at a Best Buy or a carrier store. I'm really surprised at just how good and capable this phone is. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the biggest reason I went for the Edge over the base S25 was that I found the Edge on sale at Best Buy for $799. That was too good of a deal to pass up.",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I’ve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn’t record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I’ll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn’t bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I don’t wear it while sleeping because I find it uncomfortable. Some of my friends suggested that it might be caused by the watch — possibly due to the radio frequency (RF) signals from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or LTE, or because of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. I’m wondering if there’s any truth to this and if my new headaches could really be related to the watch.",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro. What I tried:\n\n\\- clear cache and all data on galaxy wear (I've had a Samsung fit3 before)\n\n\\- completly reinstall the galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I have galaxy watch 7 plugin installed (as the wear app requested it)\n\n\\- I restarted both my phone and the watch\n\n\\- I tried multiple times, with and without logging into a samsung acount, accepting automatic updated and declining them.\n\n\\- I removed the watch from my bluetooth paired devices list\n\nHere's the steps that lead me to the issue:\n\n\\- I turn on my watch\n\n\\- I open galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I add new device\n\n\\- I press on Galaxy watch ultra under detected devices list\n\n\\- I press \"pair\" after confirming the code from the screen on the android pairing popup\n\n\\- It sometimes asks me if I want to log into samsung, I skip this step for now (same was happening when I logged in)\n\n\\- I agree to terms of service and other stuff\n\n\\- The app throws me back to my homescreen and when I want to come back to it, it shows scanning for available devices in galaxy wear app. \n\nI would really appreciate any help with that issue. The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

Will either watch lack any features when I pair with my phone, as I'm not seeing myself changing it for a couple more years. Are there some features (especially regarding activity and health metrics) that I could only have with an upper Samsung phone or a Huawei phone respectively? I know this was the case until recently but I couldn't find much info on these never models.\n\nAnd I know it comes down to personal preferences and tastes, but which watch would be better in my usage case?\n\nI should add, Samsung seems to release a non-LTE (only bluetooth) version in Turkey, where I live. So both phones are the same price (\\~500 USD).\n\nThanks in advance",

I bought an expensive (for me at least) watch8 classic because it looks like a classic watch and I want it to behave like one as well. I don't want any black screen if I move my wrist, no shaking no nothing! \n\nThe only way this bloody thing stops turning off the screen when I move my wrist is if I have the screen on \"always on\". I don't want that. I want it to turn off after 30 sec that I actually chosed in the settings. \n\nI'm about to return this awful thing and go back to Garmin. I'm so frustrated. \n\nIf someone can help me with this I would be forever grateful. ",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I’ve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn’t record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I’ll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn’t bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

I cannot get it to connect to my cmf phone 2 pro. What I tried:\n\n\\- clear cache and all data on galaxy wear (I've had a Samsung fit3 before)\n\n\\- completly reinstall the galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I have galaxy watch 7 plugin installed (as the wear app requested it)\n\n\\- I restarted both my phone and the watch\n\n\\- I tried multiple times, with and without logging into a samsung acount, accepting automatic updated and declining them.\n\n\\- I removed the watch from my bluetooth paired devices list\n\nHere's the steps that lead me to the issue:\n\n\\- I turn on my watch\n\n\\- I open galaxy wear app\n\n\\- I add new device\n\n\\- I press on Galaxy watch ultra under detected devices list\n\n\\- I press \"pair\" after confirming the code from the screen on the android pairing popup\n\n\\- It sometimes asks me if I want to log into samsung, I skip this step for now (same was happening when I logged in)\n\n\\- I agree to terms of service and other stuff\n\n\\- The app throws me back to my homescreen and when I want to come back to it, it shows scanning for available devices in galaxy wear app. \n\nI would really appreciate any help with that issue. The official samsung support is currently unavailable since it's Sunday, but judging by how hard it was to find the phone number or live chat link and fight with AI assistant to conn3ect me with human I can only hope they will help. \n\nI can post the full video of the steps I take if my internet-taught english isn't that good. \n\nAlso if my post dosen't fit the subreddit, I would really appreciate if you could point me to a right page, and I will immidietly delete this post.

It's not like the watch is hung, but on the activity screen it will keep showing only which HR Zones you are on right now. Pressing the button would let you pause or resume activity but the HR screen just remains and won't let you see the other vital information. The tracking anyway happens in the background so as long as you pause/end activity correctly it doesnt affect your data. This doesn't happen always but it does most of the time. Later I found a work around, you need to open Samsung Health app on your phone then select the activity again which kinda resets the screen, but this is such a hassle to do mid ride when you can't even see the time. I used a Galaxy Watch 4 for a short time and it never had this problem, only on my new watch I'm experiencing this bug. \n\nAnyone else experienceing this issue?",

Sometime it does and sometime it doesn't. Whenever I try to pick up the call when this is being shown on the watch face, it proceeds to show \"continue on phone\" or something like that and  the call gets picked up from the phone instead from the watch which is really annoying specially when I am riding my bike or when my phone is far away from me. Please guys tell me what does this symbol means and how to remove it permanently.",

I don’t wear it while sleeping because I find it uncomfortable. Some of my friends suggested that it might be caused by the watch — possibly due to the radio frequency (RF) signals from Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or LTE, or because of electromagnetic hypersensitivity. I’m wondering if there’s any truth to this and if my new headaches could really be related to the watch.",

So I turned of Bluetooth, then put airplane mode so lte dosent turn on nd then tucked in for the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up, lo nd behold the battery has gone down just 3%! Usually it consumes almost 12 to 15% everynight. Not just that, I reconnected it to my phone and it had tracked my sleep(along with hr and breathing) properly like it does everyday.\n\nThe thing is, in the battery section of settings it just shows what apps are using the battery which all combined isn't even 20%. \n\nSo, while being connected to the phone while your awake is non negotiable, ig it works if u want to just make it last a little longer in case u don't want to turn health features off \n\nEdit: what a weird coincidence, that someone asked a question on batter drain during night as I was writing this post, lol\n\nEdit2: corrected first line from hrs to days, sry",

    "selftext": "Ever since I updated my Watch7 to One UI 8, I’ve had issues twice with the auto-pause feature during workouts (something that never happened before on the previous version).\n\nYesterday I went for a bike ride and stopped midway to chat with a friend. The watch correctly paused the workout, but when we started moving again, I noticed later that it never resumed tracking. Result: I lost a big chunk of my ride data.\n\nToday, I went cycling again and took a short break. The watch paused as expected. When I started riding back home, I remembered the issue from yesterday and checked: it was still paused, even though I was already moving. I manually resumed it and finished the ride, but when I got home, I saw that it tracked the time of my return but didn’t record the route on the map. So the saved activity shows double the duration and only half the distance, ending exactly where it paused during my break.\n\nNot sure if a factory reset would fix this. For now, I’ll try disabling auto-pause and rely on manual pausing/unpausing, hoping it doesn’t bug out again. Otherwise, I might have to ditch Samsung Health and just record directly on Strava.\n\nAnyone else running into this issue?",

However, recently the laptop stopped charging entirely.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Tested the original charger and a different USB-C charger – both work with other devices.\n\n2. Inspected the USB-C port – no visible damage or debris.\n\n3. Performed a power reset (holding the power button for 30+ seconds).\n\n4. Replaced the battery in June \n\nDespite all of this, since this evening the charging light is not turning on, and the laptop doesn’t boot.\n\nI’m debating whether to:\n\n1. Repair it again (USB-C port or motherboard likely faulty or probably a battery issue again)\n\n2. Sell it as-is and invest in a new laptop (thinking of options like a newer Lenovo Flex 5/HP/Dell/Samsung or a MacBook).\n\nHas anyone faced a similar issue after a battery replacement or similar issues with their Lenovo flex 5? Any advice on whether repairing it is worth it, or should I cut my losses and upgrade?\n\nThanks in advance!",

When customizing it with your own, what spots do you deem as decoration friendly, and others to absolutely avoid?\n\nRight as I am typing this I took off all the stickers on the keyboard part of my laptop, and instead put in my own stickers.

    "selftext": "**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**\n\n* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**\n\n$1200ish USD.\n\n* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**\n\nEhhhhhhhh, possibly.\n\n* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**\n\nBattery Life, performance, build quality, and then form factor.\n\n* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**\n\nWeight is decently important; it will be lugged around in my backpack on campus.\n\n* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**\n\nAt least 15”, I keep two tabs open side-by-side often for schoolwork.\n\n* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**\n\nNo CAD, video or photo editing. I would hopefully like to use the laptop for playing Fortnite. However, performance and battery life for schoolwork is the most important. I will primarily be using Excel and eventually will be running SAS statistical software once I get farther in my program.\n\n* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**\n\nI’m a Fortnite girlie. I have no clue about FPS and all that honestly. I currently play on a slow asf PS4. I likely can’t afford a laptop that can run Fortnite well, that isn’t a $1600 laptop.  \n\n* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**\n\nIt needs to have at least 16gb of ram with an SSD drive. A full/numeric backlit keyboard is a must as I use it all the time. It has to have at least one USB-A port as my wireless mouse uses it.\n\n* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**\n\nI'm a new graduate student in a Master of Public Health and Master of Business Administration program in the US. The laptop will primarily be used for school work. I currently have a 2016 HP Pavillion with a 15.6\" screen, 16gb ram, and a 2tb hard drive. It's got many problems with it, one of the worst being that I'm tethered to an outlet as it doesn't last more than 20ish minutes without dying. I did a bit of research before buying that laptop, but so much has changed in 9 years especially with these new AI 🙄 laptops. I was looking at Best Buy and they seemed uber expensive for not a lot behind it simply because it's a Copilot one or whatever.\n\n \n\nMy usage: I have multiple tabs/programs open often. I already am using Excel in most of my MBA classes, and I will eventually be using SAS software in my public health classes. I utilize my laptop heavily for personal use as well. I need this laptop to be able to keep up in terms of processing speed. A good battery life is also highly important as I have 3-hour classes where there are literally 4 outlets in the classroom and I don't always get one of the outlets.",

However, recently the laptop stopped charging entirely.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Tested the original charger and a different USB-C charger – both work with other devices.\n\n2. Inspected the USB-C port – no visible damage or debris.\n\n3. Performed a power reset (holding the power button for 30+ seconds).\n\n4. Replaced the battery in June \n\nDespite all of this, since this evening the charging light is not turning on, and the laptop doesn’t boot.\n\nI’m debating whether to:\n\n1. Repair it again (USB-C port or motherboard likely faulty or probably a battery issue again)\n\n2. Sell it as-is and invest in a new laptop (thinking of options like a newer Lenovo Flex 5/HP/Dell/Samsung or a MacBook).\n\nHas anyone faced a similar issue after a battery replacement or similar issues with their Lenovo flex 5? Any advice on whether repairing it is worth it, or should I cut my losses and upgrade?\n\nThanks in advance!",

However, recently the laptop stopped charging entirely.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n1. Tested the original charger and a different USB-C charger – both work with other devices.\n\n2. Inspected the USB-C port – no visible damage or debris.\n\n3. Performed a power reset (holding the power button for 30+ seconds).\n\n4. Replaced the battery in June \n\nDespite all of this, since this evening the charging light is not turning on, and the laptop doesn’t boot.\n\nI’m debating whether to:\n\n1. Repair it again (USB-C port or motherboard likely faulty or probably a battery issue again)\n\n2. Sell it as-is and invest in a new laptop (thinking of options like a newer Lenovo Flex 5/HP/Dell/Samsung or a MacBook).\n\nHas anyone faced a similar issue after a battery replacement or similar issues with their Lenovo flex 5? Any advice on whether repairing it is worth it, or should I cut my losses and upgrade?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m running into a frustrating issue with my build and hoping someone here has experienced something similar. Here are the specs:\n\n* Motherboard: ASUS PRIME B450M-A II\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X\n* Windows 10 (fully updated)\n* BIOS version currently installed: **4632** (also tried 4644 beta)\n\n**Issue:** The system boots up fine, everything works normally. However, when I try to **shut down** or **restart**, the machine appears to go through the sequence but never actually powers off (or completes the restart).  \nInterestingly, if I boot into **Safe Mode**, the shutdown works just fine.\n\nWhat I’ve already done:\n\n* Cleared CMOS\n* Installed latest AMD chipset drivers (uninstalled old ones first)\n* Disabled Global C-State/DF Cstates in BIOS\n* Disabled Fast Startup in Windows\n* Used power plan “AMD Ryzen Balanced” and tested high performance mode\n\n**Symptoms point to a bodged power state or firmware bug** — everything works in Safe Mode, so drivers/hardware largely seem OK. In normal mode, the shutdown/restart command never fully completes.\n\nMy suspicion: there’s a bug in the AGESA/BIOS version (for this board) that fails to handle S5 (power-off) or S3 states correctly with the Ryzen 5000 series. I’ve seen some users mention BIOS versions that fix “power state / shutdown bug” for B450 + Ryzen 5000, but I can’t find a listed stable version for my board in my region.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone here faced exactly the same “won’t shut down / restart” issue on a B450 board with a Ryzen 5000 CPU?\n* Did a BIOS update (if you managed to find one) fix this for you? Which version?\n* Any other workarounds that got shutdown/restart to work normally without needing to cut power manually?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or insights!",

I got hold of KLEVV CRAS V DDR5 RGB 32GB (2X 16GB) 7200MHz CL34 Gaming Memory RAM Kit XMP 3.0 High Performance Overclocking 34-44-44-84 . I got it for 120 Euros and in my country this cheap ! \n\nNow i need to build PC. I know its sounds awkward but i was planing to get new pc for a while and  Tuesday/Wednesday im ordering my parts. \n\nMy use case: Linux/FreeBSD ( 99%  and  occasional gaming 1% ).\n\nWhat do i run? Python ( including Django, Streamlit), nginx, postgresql, local git repository, tons of tabs on chromium , firefox , brave, ollama, office ( excel ) and will be running some CAD software for 3D printing and some software for electrical stuff for prototyping circuit boards.\n\nPC#1: AM5 R5 7500F ( 145 Euros ) or R7 7700 ( 200- 220 Euros )  , Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite (rev 1.3 ) ( 150 Euros )\n\nPC#2: LGA 1851 245K ( 212 Euros ), Gigabyte Z890M ( 250 Euros ) \n\nBoth motherboards accept this memory sticks. \n\nPC will be water cooled.  \nI was looking for updated 1851 benchmarks but there is nothing out there after 200S boost update and all the info is kinda bad towards intel \n\nTPU had python, db, git etc benchmarks but benchmarks are old as they release when intels 1851 was launched ( almost 12 months ago ). Youtubers shows when undervolting and overclocking , descent speed ram - intel looks performant but they dont have these benchmarks like TPU\n\nAt the moment im ok with these cpu choices and both platforms have future cpu releases (amd zen 6 and intel \"refresh\" for same platform)\n\nIm not planing of changing my pc for a while ( 4-5 years  at least)\n\nP.s. im not sure i want to wait for another month or more or new year as pricing in my country is like  stock market and my WS and me are tired of slow opening of PDF files ( almost 1min and sometimes i have to open 100+ a day), excel sheet etc. ( i do have tons or RAM  but its 2133 ddr4 ecc  and in quad config  dual xeon quad channel board and cpu\\`s) \n\nThank You.",

    "selftext": "Im looking at rebuilding my PC. I have a custom case which involves air filters due to needing to work in a very dusty area (think an active woodworking shop plus pet hairs and spray paint and all sorts of other things in the air at any given point). The initial build had 6 standard 120 mm fans, 3 pulling air in, and three pushing air out. The filter process fitting pieces of a furnace air filter across the outside of the fans, and the case being sealed otherwise. This was not sufficient for cooling, outside of very basic web browsing use. \n\nThe rebuild will be similarly sealed and filtered, but will use a liquid CPU cooler with the cooling fins and fans external to the sealed case to export heat. I have also made some alterations, so i can up the ante and have 8 fans instead of 6.\n\nAnyway.. the question for today is.. are there any PC fans that will prove sufficient to pushing/pulling air through a physical filter? Obviously no matter what it will reduce the efficiency of the fans from their normal expected operation, But would upgrading to premium fans or some specialty fan actually make any difference?\n\nSecondary question is.. should i have even numbers of fans pushing and pulling for an otherwise sealed case, or should I have more one way or the other? I assume it makes sense to put the outflow fans on the top, as heat will rise and be more efficiently vented there, as well as dust being pushed off of those filters into the room, rather than sucked in and held by pressure and gravity, and that it makes sense to put inflow fans towards the bottom of a wall mounted case for the same reasons.

But my main interest is going back to valorant since my laptop doesn't run it anymore.\n\nSo, im trying not to go over 600$. I've been eyeing builds without GPUs (since those are very expensive) and Google says I can play the games i want without one. \n\nThing is, my friend (who's like this tech guy that has a monster of a pc) says that I ABSOLUTELY need a GPU for my pc, and suggested I downgrade the cpu to try and squeeze one into my budget because I won't be able to play games without it. He got a bit defensive when I mentioned that I didn't really think I needed it, and he said that I would regret not getting one in the long run. \n\nIs that really truth? Can someone explain it to me? I'm really confused. I've been looking in some spaces and some people agree and some people say it's not that necessary for light gaming. \n\nThanks for the help in advance c:",

    "selftext": "Hello, I have a following problem which I've been struggling today while upgrading pc. \n\nI've just changed the base of PC - Motherboard/Rams/CPU. \n\nEverything worked out perfectly - device booted up - MSI center autoinstallation appeared - Installed and restarted 2 times afterwards - That is where my problem begins. \n\nNot sure if it happened before or after this restart, but after i went into file explorer - i noticed missing one partition from PC. Had C - 200GB E: 300GB and D: 500GB. \n\nD: Partition - Vanished completely - The only sign that it was there was recent searches which is \"D: ?\" now and all of the files/games are missing. \n\nIt seems like Bios/Motherboard/Drivers see the SSD but wrognly. In reality i have Crucial 1TB 2,5\" SATA SSD MX500.\n\nHowever it looks like it is now 500GB and everything acts like that's the reality now :D \n\nPartition is not hidden. There is no unallocated storage. I tried remove 1GB of one of the partition - the 1GB appeared as unallocated - nothing more. \n\nTried updating some drivers - nothing. BIOS is on 1.0L version if I can see correctly - Not sure if that is the correct one - I had it flashed by the store which i bought it from to avoid bricking it myself. \n\nThought it might be becaue I didn't use the fresh install. I decided to create boot stick with win 11 - Unfortunately, during the installation i could already see it's missing the 500GB. Just went through with it and finished with one partition so that it's just done. Installed correctly - Still missing 500GB. \n\nAny idea what should i look at more? Maybe the BIOS version or some settings there that could cause this? \n\nIt's literally like PC see the wrong type of SSD. 500GB instead of 1 TB. \n\n",

List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**\n\nClicking Start menu -> power options -> sleep makes the PC turn off instead. It doesn't go to a shut down screen or anything, the monitors just go black and a moment later the PC turns off. I have to press the power button to re-turn it on and all my programs are closed. It also seemed to shut down when hibernating so I ended up disabling that. I'm not sure what the issue could be, so I thought to update the BIOS, but that's also not working for some reason.\n\n**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**\n\n**Sleep = Shut down:** I saw that Windows 11 shuts down hard drives after 20 minutes by default so I turned that off, I've also just disabled any timeout / power saving anything to prevent it from accidentally shutting it down. I don't see how anything can make clicking Sleep make it Shut Down instead.\n\n**BIOS:** I have zero idea. I've tried multiple flash drives in multiple ports, including the one labeled BIOS. Downloaded the update directly from ASUS, ran their renamer tool and put the renamed update file on the flash drive by itself. The BIOS sees it and acknowledges that it's an updated file on there, then when I run its auto-updater and check it, it's still the old version. I'm assuming the sleep/shut down issue is preventing it from updating.",

The more details the better.**\n\n* Gaming: primarily VR sim racing with mods and custom shaders.\n* Photo editing: processing 48 MP files from a Nikon D850 in Adobe Lightroom.\n\n**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**\n\nI'll be driving a Samsung Odyssey G9 (49″, 5120 × 1440). I also have a 34″ 2K ultrawide. I'm aiming for high frame rates on the G9 for smooth VR sim racing at high settings.\n\n**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**\n\nAround $5,000; the parts below (except the CPU cooler) are already purchased and came in under budget.\n\n**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**\n\nUSA.\n\n**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.\n\n| Component | Part | Price |\n|-----------|------|-------|\n| CPU | AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D (16‑core, 4.3 GHz) | $654.77 |\n| CPU Cooler | (not yet purchased) | — |\n| Motherboard | Gigabyte X870E AORUS ELITE WIFI7 (ATX, AM5) | $316.45 |\n| Memory | Silicon Power Value Gaming DDR5 64 GB (2 × 32 GB) 6000 MT/s CL30 | $305.54 |\n| Storage | Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4 TB M.2‑2280 PCIe 5.0×2 NVMe SSD | $272.80 |\n| Storage | Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4 TB M.2‑2280 PCIe 5.0×2 NVMe SSD | $272.80 |\n| Video Card | PNY OC GeForce RTX 5090 32 GB | $2,181.41 |\n| Case | Fractal Design North XL ATX full‑tower | $172.51 |\n| Power Supply | Corsair RM1200x SHIFT 1200 W 80+ Gold fully modular | $196.41 |\n\n**Provide any additional details you wish below.**\n\nAll parts listed (except the CPU cooler) are already purchased at post‑tax final prices. I'm mainly looking for feedback on thermals.\n\nI basically have a few questions:\n\n1. Should I stop being a cheap bastard about the cooling and just get an AIO and make this a liquid cooled build?\n2. If not, do people have examples of 5090 builds with adequate air cooling that I can copy/do people have suggestions?\n3. Are there any considerations I should make at all about compatibility?\n4. I'm severely paranoid about sinking this much money into a PC and then having everything fail because of the 5090 power connector issue. I was also thinking of picking up an [Aqua Computer AMPINEL](https://forum.aquacomputer.de/weitere-foren/english-forum/114449-new-ampinel-active-power-management-for-graphics-cards-safe-and-intelligent/) when they release it in November. If money is no object with respect to safety, then is it worth waiting for this and just building afterward?",

While we had the computer unplugged and open for cleaning,  we flipped the switch on our MSI 4070 Ti super from \"silent\" to \"gaming\". It hasn't turned on normally since. We disconnected everthing and switched the gpu back to \"silent\" then tried booting again. The boot indicator lights doing the same thing. Yellow,  red, then white on with one green flash. We disconnected everthing once again and took the gpu out and reseated it. Still not booting. Any advice? Thanks",

    "title": "Building My First PC... Slowly! Budget is 3000-4000 AED. Need a Staged Gaming/Work Build Plan",
    "selftext": "Hey r/buildapc\n​I'm finally trying to build my own PC, but my wallet won't let me do it all at once. I need a solid machine that can handle both 1440p gaming (think AAA titles like Cyberpunk, but also competitive FPS) and general work/multitasking.\n​The plan is to buy the parts over the next 5 to 6 months. This staged approach means I really need to plan the purchases perfectly so I don't end up with an outdated CPU or a dead-end motherboard halfway through!\n​My Goal & Budget:\n​Primary Use: 60% Gaming / 40% Work & Multitasking.\n​Gaming Target: Stable 1440p performance.\n​Total Budget: Roughly 3,000 - 4,000 AED (UAE Dirhams).\n​Country: UAE (Looking for advice based on local prices/availability if possible).\n​The Big Questions:\n​Ideal Buy Order: What's the best sequence to buy the parts? Should I start with the PSU/Case, or jump straight to the CPU/Mobo? I need to avoid buying anything too early that might get superseded before I finish the build.\n​Part List: Can someone draft a balanced component list for a 3000-4000 AED build that's good for 1440p? I'm open to both AMD and Intel.\n​The Wait: If I buy the Motherboard and CPU in month one, is it okay to wait 3-4 months before buying the GPU? How long is too long to keep components sitting around?\n​Any advice on which parts to prioritize or even great deals to look out for in the UAE would be awesome. Thanks in advance",

I’ve tried many combinations of bios settings and installing drivers off asus website, to no avail.

When I turned on the computer, it became slow without having anything open. I went into the task manager to see if it was a component that was being used too much. What I saw was that the cpu was being used at 40% - 60%, but the programs that were shown using that percentage were the ones that I use daily, that is, SignalRGB, FanControl, My antivirus (ESET), and the rest of the system's things. I checked one by one by opening the locations to see if any of them were the ones in the system. problem, but no. After spending a few minutes with the PC being this slow, it turns off by itself, I turn it back on and as if by magic everything is the same, I enter the task manager again and I find that the CPU is now used at 4% - 10% with the same programs open, I looked to see if there was anyone else with that problem, I found another post on Reddit that talked about a similar problem, according to the responses it could be errors in hibernation mode. I tried the solution and deactivated the hibernation mode but nothing, the problem is still there, it is not a temperature problem either, because at no time do the fans start to spin at their maximum.\n\nI also clarify that I have not downloaded anything pirated or anything from strange pages, there would not even be strange emails, in addition to the fact that I have an antivirus, which although it is not something that completely rules out having viruses, it is an extra layer of security",

A new CPU is in the cards, and I'm tempted to go ahead and take the plunge on the 9800x3d.\n\nFrom what I've looked into, the 9800x3d has insanely great power efficiency and really good thermals for being the current gaming CPU king - running cooler than most of the non-x3D CPUs in many game demos...\n\nMy question for current 9800x3d owners - are the thermals really that good in your real world use? And if my current CPU cooler is just a single tower air cooler (Deepcool AG500 - 5 pipes/slightly larger heatsink) - will that cooler be enough? Or should I consider grabbing an inexpensive dual tower cooler? \n\nThanks!\n\n",

I’d also like it to be able to run GTA VI when it comes out. I know there’s no concrete info yet, but maybe you can tell me if this build looks good enough for that.\n\nhttps://pt.pcpartpicker.com/list/VvgtMC\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor\nCooler: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler\nMotherboard: ASRock B850M Pro RS WiFi Micro ATX AM5 Motherboard\nRAM: TEAMGROUP T-Create Expert 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory\nSSD: TEAMGROUP T-FORCE G50 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive\nGPU: Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 9070 XT 16 GB Video Card\nCase: Montech XR ATX Mid Tower Case\nPSU: Montech CENTURY II 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n\nThe total price is around €1600 (Portugal). I’ll probably buy the CPU and motherboard from Amazon Spain since they’re cheaper there.\n\nSomeone suggested a Ryzen 5 7600X with an RX 9060 XT instead, since my original goal was to spend around €1200, but I got hesitant. In Football Manager I use databases with over 500k players and multiple active leagues, so I thought the Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RX 9070 XT would be safer choices for better performance and longevity. Am I overdoing it, or does that make sense?\n\nI also have a few questions:\nCan I save money on any part without losing real quality like the motherboard, cooler or case?\nDoes the case have good airflow or should I add extra fans?\nIs the PSU powerful and reliable enough?\nI’ve seen different RX 9070 XT models. Are those just different brands? Is the Sapphire Pulse a good choice?\nAnd do you think it’s worth waiting for Black Friday/Cyber Monday to see if prices drop?\n\nLastly, I also need a monitor around €200. Do you have any recommendations? I saw the AOC Q27G3XMN reviewed on rtings.com and it looked good, but I’m completely lost in this area. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just really don’t want to make any mistakes.\nThanks to anyone who replies!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have 12GB of RAM in my computer, one 8GB 2400MHz module and one 4GB with a lower frequency that I don't remember. I've been thinking about buying another 8GB module for a total of 16GB for a while, but this desire increased after I came across some games that I feel should perform better, since I have a relatively good graphic card (RTX 3050 TI). The main one is Marvel Rivals, which popularly has performance issues, but I've seen several situations where people managed to solve them with some steps that I tried to reproduce, but with no success. Elden Ring and Spider-Man also have lower frame rates than I think they should achieve, and I need to reduce some graphics settings. So, I bought a second 8GB module with 2666MHz (the maximum my motherboard supports with my processor), knowing that its frequency will be reduced to 2400MHz to keep up with the other module. My question is: Can I expect significant changes in the performance of games like Marvel Rivals (worst case scenario) or is this difference in RAM not enough? ",

    "selftext": "Hey all. I've decided it's finally time to upgrade my rig. My last (and current) build was completed back in mid-late 2019; I've been running an *AMD Ryzen 5 2600* paired with an *RTX 2060* for the duration.\n\nThe build has served me incredibly well for my purposes, but it's time for me to get with the times, as I realise I'm habitually lowering settings in any new video game I pick up in order to maintain decent FPS (and even then I'm starting to struggle on lowest).\n\nAs such, my main goal with this build is to attain stable FPS on higher settings in modern video games. To this end I also intend a significant upgrade to my monitor to take advantage of the higher specs, as I've been using a generic 60hz LCD monitor I got from a big-box store around fifteen years ago.\n\nI will not be committing to meaningful 3d or video rendering or anything of that sort, so no such considerations apply.\n\nI'm living in the United Kingdom, and I don't aim to go over a build cost of **£2,500.00** (approx. **$3,327.00**), but I'm open to a little flexibility if it proves necessary.\n\nZero components of my prior build are moving over with me (excepting some storage; I likewise presume to boot a fresh install of Windows 11 from an SSD). As a result I've come up with the following build after a bit of googling and consideration:\n\n----\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/83GJh7)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/fPyH99/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-47-ghz-8-core-processor-100-1000001084wof) | £399.95 @ Amazon UK \n**CPU Cooler** | [Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/hYxRsY/thermalright-peerless-assassin-120-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-pa120-se-d3) | £29.00 @ Computer Orbit \n**Motherboard** | [Asus TUF GAMING B850-PLUS WIFI ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/sRG2FT/asus-tuf-gaming-b850-plus-wifi-atx-am5-motherboard-tuf-gaming-b850-plus-wifi) | £199.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Memory** | [Corsair Vengeance 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/JkfxFT/corsair-vengeance-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmk32gx5m2b6000c30) | £166.87 @ Amazon UK \n**Video Card** | [Gigabyte WINDFORCE SFF GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB Video Card](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/8PFCmG/gigabyte-windforce-sff-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16-gb-video-card-gv-n507twf3-16gd) | £836.59 @ Senetic \n**Case** | [Corsair FRAME 4000D ATX Mid Tower Case](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/nbXMnQ/corsair-frame-4000d-atx-mid-tower-case-cc-9011290-ww) | £74.99 @ AWD-IT \n**Power Supply** | [Corsair RM850x (2024) 850 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/vY4Zxr/corsair-rm850x-2024-850-w-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020270-na) | £119.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Case Fan** | [Corsair RS120 72.8 CFM 120 mm Fans 3-Pack](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/cbmNnQ/corsair-rs120-728-cfm-120-mm-fans-3-pack-co-9050189-ww) | £23.99 @ Amazon UK \n**Monitor** | [Gigabyte MO27Q28G 27.0\" 2560 x 1440 280 Hz Monitor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/6XWmP6/gigabyte-mo27q28g-270-2560-x-1440-280-hz-monitor-mo27q28g) |-\n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **£1851.37**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-10-26 17:22 GMT+0000 |\n\nWith the price of the monitor included (excluded from the above list due to recency of release), this totals ~**£2,351.36** (approx. **$3,129.19**).\n\n----\n\nA few things are worth noting:\n\n- One, I understand the PSU has a meaningful buffer zone given my chosen components, I figured this as some acceptable future-proofing, and the price difference between lower options is negligible.\n\n- Secondly, I understand there have been some quibbles over Corsair's *DDR5* sticks as of late; I've looked over a few options with 6000mhz CL30 specifications, but ultimately these Corsairs seem the most available option at this moment. I'm likewise happy being a touch overkill with 2 x 16.\n\n- Thirdly, I'm open for opinions on my choice of GPU. The *5070 Ti* seems the best option for my pricing and requirements, but I'm happy to hear other takes. It's also worth noting that the specific model can be changed if required; the *Windforce* was selected as it is the cheapest option I found on Amazon at this point in time.\n\n- Fourthly, I *think* the case and fan situation is fine given the rest of my choices. The CPU cooler was fairly arbitrarily chosen, but if I'm missing something and it's not going to fit as expected, I'm sure I can just smash it with a hammer until it does (I'll be able to determine any issues with these cheaper components at the point of assembly regardless)—this being said, if you think there are any issues with this case, do let me know. Cable management on my last one (the *Phanteks Eclipse P350X*) was a bastard, so avoiding such barriers this time around would be ideal. Avoiding flashy RGB cases is of primary concern, also!\n\n- Lastly, and this is just a fun one that's doesn't exactly pertain to the build's hardware itself, but is worth noting regardless: my choice of monitor is quite specific—I understand all of the discussions being had about WOLED vs. QD-OLED, etc.—I settled on the *MO27Q28G* based on its price point and my specific lighting conditions, so I'm pretty happy with it.\n\n----\n\nI am mostly making this post to make sure my general tech-illiteracy isn't blinding me to any obvious flaws, but I'm also happy to hear any other perspectives or changes you guys would personally make.\n\nMany thanks in advance for your consideration.",

    "selftext": "Since the release of the RTX 5080, there’s been a lots of issues - from ridiculous pricing to overheating and melting reports. I decided to wait for the 5080 Ti, hoping Nvidia would fix those problems, but I’ve come to realize it’s probably never coming. And even if it does, it’ll be overpriced as hell.\n\nSo I started looking for alternatives.  \nRight now, I see three realistic options:\n\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** \\- around €950 in my country. Slightly lower performance, but much better value.\n* **RX 9070 XT** \\-  about €750, even stronger price/performance ratio. The thing is… I’ve been burned by AMD drivers before. My old 6800 XT literally died because of them, and DLSS still beats even the newest FSR in both quality and adoption.\n* **RTX 5080** \\- averages €1340. I'm just afraid of this card. I've heard only bad things about it. And it's cost almost twice as best AMD GPU.\n\nFor reference, here’s my current setup:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4 @ 4,396 MHz\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n* **Main monitor:** 1440p HDR\n* **Secondary:** 1440p (YouTube / multitasking)\n* **PSU:** be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo… what would you do in my place?",

Python ( including Django, Streamlit), nginx, postgresql, local git repository, tons of tabs on chromium , firefox , brave, ollama, office ( excel ) and will be running some CAD software for 3D printing and some software for electrical stuff for prototyping circuit boards.\n\nPC#1: AM5 R5 7500F ( 145 Euros ) or R7 7700 ( 200- 220 Euros )  , Gigabyte B650M Aorus Elite (rev 1.3 ) ( 150 Euros )\n\nPC#2: LGA 1851 245K ( 212 Euros ), Gigabyte Z890M ( 250 Euros ) \n\nBoth motherboards accept this memory sticks. \n\nPC will be water cooled.  \nI was looking for updated 1851 benchmarks but there is nothing out there after 200S boost update and all the info is kinda bad towards intel \n\nTPU had python, db, git etc benchmarks but benchmarks are old as they release when intels 1851 was launched ( almost 12 months ago ). Youtubers shows when undervolting and overclocking , descent speed ram - intel looks performant but they dont have these benchmarks like TPU\n\nAt the moment im ok with these cpu choices and both platforms have future cpu releases (amd zen 6 and intel \"refresh\" for same platform)\n\nIm not planing of changing my pc for a while ( 4-5 years  at least)\n\nP.s. im not sure i want to wait for another month or more or new year as pricing in my country is like  stock market and my WS and me are tired of slow opening of PDF files ( almost 1min and sometimes i have to open 100+ a day), excel sheet etc. ( i do have tons or RAM  but its 2133 ddr4 ecc  and in quad config  dual xeon quad channel board and cpu\\`s) \n\nThank You.",

    "selftext": "Im looking at rebuilding my PC. I have a custom case which involves air filters due to needing to work in a very dusty area (think an active woodworking shop plus pet hairs and spray paint and all sorts of other things in the air at any given point). The initial build had 6 standard 120 mm fans, 3 pulling air in, and three pushing air out. The filter process fitting pieces of a furnace air filter across the outside of the fans, and the case being sealed otherwise. This was not sufficient for cooling, outside of very basic web browsing use. \n\nThe rebuild will be similarly sealed and filtered, but will use a liquid CPU cooler with the cooling fins and fans external to the sealed case to export heat. I have also made some alterations, so i can up the ante and have 8 fans instead of 6.\n\nAnyway.. the question for today is.. are there any PC fans that will prove sufficient to pushing/pulling air through a physical filter? Obviously no matter what it will reduce the efficiency of the fans from their normal expected operation, But would upgrading to premium fans or some specialty fan actually make any difference?\n\nSecondary question is.. should i have even numbers of fans pushing and pulling for an otherwise sealed case, or should I have more one way or the other? I assume it makes sense to put the outflow fans on the top, as heat will rise and be more efficiently vented there, as well as dust being pushed off of those filters into the room, rather than sucked in and held by pressure and gravity, and that it makes sense to put inflow fans towards the bottom of a wall mounted case for the same reasons.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m trying to decide between the **RX 9070 XT** and the **RTX 5070 (non-Ti)**.  \nThe **price difference is around $130** in my country after discounts.\n\nMy CPU is a **Ryzen 5 7500F**, paired with 32GB of RAM.\n\nHere’s my use case:\n\n* I mainly play **VR** games like **DCS**, **MSFS**, and other simulation titles.\n* I also play regular **1080p** games (maybe 1440p later).\n* I care about **smooth VR performance, consistent frame pacing, and stability**.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen:\n\n* RX 9070 XT seems about **20–25% faster** in raw raster performance.\n* But I’m not sure how well it performs in **VR**, especially in DCS or MSFS.\n* I’ve heard **NVIDIA still has better driver optimization and VR stability**, while AMD has improved a lot with **FSR4, AFMF, and driver updates**.\n\nDo you think the **RX 9070 XT** is worth the extra $130 over the **RTX 5070** if my main focus is **VR simulation and 1080p gaming**?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has tested these cards in VR!",

But my main interest is going back to valorant since my laptop doesn't run it anymore.\n\nSo, im trying not to go over 600$. I've been eyeing builds without GPUs (since those are very expensive) and Google says I can play the games i want without one. \n\nThing is, my friend (who's like this tech guy that has a monster of a pc) says that I ABSOLUTELY need a GPU for my pc, and suggested I downgrade the cpu to try and squeeze one into my budget because I won't be able to play games without it. He got a bit defensive when I mentioned that I didn't really think I needed it, and he said that I would regret not getting one in the long run. \n\nIs that really truth? Can someone explain it to me? I'm really confused.

In reality i have Crucial 1TB 2,5\" SATA SSD MX500.\n\nHowever it looks like it is now 500GB and everything acts like that's the reality now :D \n\nPartition is not hidden. There is no unallocated storage. I tried remove 1GB of one of the partition - the 1GB appeared as unallocated - nothing more. \n\nTried updating some drivers - nothing. BIOS is on 1.0L version if I can see correctly - Not sure if that is the correct one - I had it flashed by the store which i bought it from to avoid bricking it myself. \n\nThought it might be becaue I didn't use the fresh install. I decided to create boot stick with win 11 - Unfortunately, during the installation i could already see it's missing the 500GB. Just went through with it and finished with one partition so that it's just done. Installed correctly - Still missing 500GB. \n\nAny idea what should i look at more? Maybe the BIOS version or some settings there that could cause this? \n\nIt's literally like PC see the wrong type of SSD. 500GB instead of 1 TB. \n\n",

It doesn't go to a shut down screen or anything, the monitors just go black and a moment later the PC turns off. I have to press the power button to re-turn it on and all my programs are closed. It also seemed to shut down when hibernating so I ended up disabling that. I'm not sure what the issue could be, so I thought to update the BIOS, but that's also not working for some reason.\n\n**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**\n\n**Sleep = Shut down:** I saw that Windows 11 shuts down hard drives after 20 minutes by default so I turned that off, I've also just disabled any timeout / power saving anything to prevent it from accidentally shutting it down. I don't see how anything can make clicking Sleep make it Shut Down instead.\n\n**BIOS:** I have zero idea. I've tried multiple flash drives in multiple ports, including the one labeled BIOS. Downloaded the update directly from ASUS, ran their renamer tool and put the renamed update file on the flash drive by itself. The BIOS sees it and acknowledges that it's an updated file on there, then when I run its auto-updater and check it, it's still the old version. I'm assuming the sleep/shut down issue is preventing it from updating.",

    "title": "From 3080 Ti to what next? Nvidia’s prices got me rethinking everything.",
    "selftext": "Since the release of the RTX 5080, there’s been a lots of issues - from ridiculous pricing to overheating and melting reports. I decided to wait for the 5080 Ti, hoping Nvidia would fix those problems, but I’ve come to realize it’s probably never coming. And even if it does, it’ll be overpriced as hell.\n\nSo I started looking for alternatives.  \nRight now, I see three realistic options:\n\n* **RTX 5070 Ti** \\- around €950 in my country. Slightly lower performance, but much better value.\n* **RX 9070 XT** \\-  about €750, even stronger price/performance ratio. The thing is… I’ve been burned by AMD drivers before. My old 6800 XT literally died because of them, and DLSS still beats even the newest FSR in both quality and adoption.\n* **RTX 5080** \\- averages €1340. I'm just afraid of this card. I've heard only bad things about it. And it's cost almost twice as best AMD GPU.\n\nFor reference, here’s my current setup:\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PLUS (Wi-Fi)\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4 @ 4,396 MHz\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti\n* **Main monitor:** 1440p HDR\n* **Secondary:** 1440p (YouTube / multitasking)\n* **PSU:** be quiet! Pure Power 12 M 1200 W (yeah, I know, overkill)\n\nMy 3080 Ti is starting to choke on newer titles, and the lack of access to modern upscaling tech is becoming noticeable.  \nIt sucks that so much of GPU performance now relies on software tricks, but here we are.\n\nSo… what would you do in my place?",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m running into a frustrating issue with my build and hoping someone here has experienced something similar. Here are the specs:\n\n* Motherboard: ASUS PRIME B450M-A II\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X\n* Windows 10 (fully updated)\n* BIOS version currently installed: **4632** (also tried 4644 beta)\n\n**Issue:** The system boots up fine, everything works normally. However, when I try to **shut down** or **restart**, the machine appears to go through the sequence but never actually powers off (or completes the restart).  \nInterestingly, if I boot into **Safe Mode**, the shutdown works just fine.\n\nWhat I’ve already done:\n\n* Cleared CMOS\n* Installed latest AMD chipset drivers (uninstalled old ones first)\n* Disabled Global C-State/DF Cstates in BIOS\n* Disabled Fast Startup in Windows\n* Used power plan “AMD Ryzen Balanced” and tested high performance mode\n\n**Symptoms point to a bodged power state or firmware bug** — everything works in Safe Mode, so drivers/hardware largely seem OK. In normal mode, the shutdown/restart command never fully completes.\n\nMy suspicion: there’s a bug in the AGESA/BIOS version (for this board) that fails to handle S5 (power-off) or S3 states correctly with the Ryzen 5000 series. I’ve seen some users mention BIOS versions that fix “power state / shutdown bug” for B450 + Ryzen 5000, but I can’t find a listed stable version for my board in my region.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Has anyone here faced exactly the same “won’t shut down / restart” issue on a B450 board with a Ryzen 5000 CPU?\n* Did a BIOS update (if you managed to find one) fix this for you? Which version?\n* Any other workarounds that got shutdown/restart to work normally without needing to cut power manually?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or insights!",

I have a custom case which involves air filters due to needing to work in a very dusty area (think an active woodworking shop plus pet hairs and spray paint and all sorts of other things in the air at any given point). The initial build had 6 standard 120 mm fans, 3 pulling air in, and three pushing air out. The filter process fitting pieces of a furnace air filter across the outside of the fans, and the case being sealed otherwise. This was not sufficient for cooling, outside of very basic web browsing use. \n\nThe rebuild will be similarly sealed and filtered, but will use a liquid CPU cooler with the cooling fins and fans external to the sealed case to export heat. I have also made some alterations, so i can up the ante and have 8 fans instead of 6.\n\nAnyway.. the question for today is.. are there any PC fans that will prove sufficient to pushing/pulling air through a physical filter? Obviously no matter what it will reduce the efficiency of the fans from their normal expected operation, But would upgrading to premium fans or some specialty fan actually make any difference?\n\nSecondary question is.. should i have even numbers of fans pushing and pulling for an otherwise sealed case, or should I have more one way or the other? I assume it makes sense to put the outflow fans on the top, as heat will rise and be more efficiently vented there, as well as dust being pushed off of those filters into the room, rather than sucked in and held by pressure and gravity, and that it makes sense to put inflow fans towards the bottom of a wall mounted case for the same reasons.

What allignment do they go in? Where do they plug? Just a little stumped and these little buggers come undone too easy, so clearly I probably am not putting them in the right spot. \n",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features. The Outer Worlds 2 showcases impressive narrative adaptability to player choices, lacking only a bit of technical ambition and polish to rank among the best role-playing games of today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.2 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=310629)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 showcases Obsidian's RPG mastery through meaningful choices and dynamic character building, though the world lacks the vibrancy of modern open-world games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [7.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it’s undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deceptively smart Looter-shooter RPG with colourful worlds and entertaining characters, and some really satisfying, malleable combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3825/the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience. However, it unfortunately falters in its narrative, with a lackluster story and unconvincing companions that fail to engage, leaving a technically proficient but less inspired adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [3.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a serviceable RPG held back from greatness by playing it too safe and small. Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain’t broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of déjà vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dzięglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

You can prove me wrong 😀\n\nGameplay consists of simple first person point-and-click mechanics. Where it stands out is interactivity. Environment is carefully hand-crafted with attention to detail, from the architecture of the buildings all the way down to the flushing sounds in the toilet.\n\nThe estimated length of the game is roughly 2 hours i would say. The length of the game depends on how fast you solve the puzzles. Some of them might be slightly on the more difficult side of the spectrum since they are a little bit unconventional.\n\n**Main features**\n\n* **Atmospheric first-person** mystery with light point-and-click style interactions.  \n* **Highly interactive environments** \\- almost everything reacts: drawers, switches, computers, instruments, sauna, etc.  \n* **Environmental storytelling**: newspapers, phones, and tiny props that hide clues.  \n* **Puzzles** that skew a bit **unconventional** \\- some are simple, a few are “huh… wait” moments by design.  \n\nBuilt to reward **curiosity** and **note-taking** rather than brute forcing.",

    "selftext": "To be more specific, Massive Entertainment put out a social media statement implying that they're encouraging staff to voluntarily leave the company/lay themselves off with benefits/company assistance:\n\n\"As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games. To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that [Star Wars Outlaws underperformed in Ubisoft's eyes.](https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed) It seems Avatar did better, but most likely not enough to prevent Massive from being a target in this \"restructuring\".\n\n(Note for mods: resubmitting this post with an edited title for clarity and a synopsis in the post description. I hope this doesn't count as editorializing, I just saw some people in the previous thread I posted take issue with the lack of clarity in the article title.)",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

In battle, you can deploy units alongside you (and give them orders via a tactical pause, if you want), and on a macro level you will seamlessly manage resources, supply lines, capture and defend locations, build structures, and more on a constantly evolving (in real time) strategic map. The game has 3 distinct nations, all fully playable and asymmetrical!\n\nWe're all fans of RTS's so with this game we wanted the feeling of playing an RTS but with the immersion of a real time 3rd person shooter, and without the micro of course (if that makes sense) - with all the unit choice, counters, and tactical decision making involved!\n\n[Noblemen: 1941 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000510/Noblemen_1941/)",

The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ACG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/310/acg)** - [Jeremy Penter](https://opencritic.com/critic/1355/jeremy-penter) - [Buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW3SH8LmZeg)\n\n>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!\"\n\n-------------\n\n**[AltChar](https://opencritic.com/outlet/820/altchar)** - [Asmir Kovacevic](https://opencritic.com/critic/9667/asmir-kovacevic) - [85 / 100](https://www.altchar.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-an-action-rpg-with-plenty-of-flavour-aFOAp6r0u3Zi)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.\n>\n>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. \n>\n>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Atarita](https://opencritic.com/outlet/885/atarita)** - [Eren Eroğlu](https://opencritic.com/critic/8383/eren-ero-lu) - *Turkish* - [82 / 100](https://www.atarita.com/the-outer-worlds-2-inceleme/)\n\n>Although The Outer Worlds 2 has its shortcomings, it was still a highly enjoyable RPG experience in which I loved spending time in its world and exploring its universe.\n\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Charles Hartford](https://opencritic.com/critic/6624/charles-hartford) - [9 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 comes together to deliver a fantastic journey. Despite some narrative hiccups, the worlds, organizations and individual players encounter, and sometimes kill, are always engaging and frequently fun.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CNET](https://opencritic.com/outlet/957/cnet)** - [Oscar Gonzalez](https://opencritic.com/critic/11186/oscar-gonzalez) - [Unscored](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - [Mark Steighner](https://opencritic.com/critic/885/mark-steighner) - [85 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Chicas Gamers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/773/chicas-gamers)** - [Sergio Diaz](https://opencritic.com/critic/10410/sergio-diaz) - *Spanish* - [8.6 / 10](https://www.chicasgamers.com/2025/10/analisis-the-outer-worlds-2-pc.html)\n\n>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)\n\n>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)\n\n>\"An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom\"\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)\n\n>\"The Outer Worlds 2\" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.\n>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Echo Boomer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/702/echo-boomer)** - [David Fialho](https://opencritic.com/critic/6219/david-fialho) - *Portuguese* - [No Recommendation](https://echoboomer.pt/the-outer-worlds-2-review-velhos-costumes-nunca-morrem)\n\n>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Giovanni Panzano](https://opencritic.com/critic/8253/giovanni-panzano) - *Italian* - [8.7 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-gdr-eccezionale-offre-liberta-impressionante-66311.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Final Weapon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/727/final-weapon)** - [Saras Rajpal](https://opencritic.com/critic/9891/saras-rajpal) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://finalweapon.net/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Sönke Siemens](https://opencritic.com/critic/7212/s-nke-siemens) - *German* - [86%](https://www.games.ch/outer-worlds-2/test/review-m7ih/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Filip Melzacki](https://opencritic.com/critic/10885/filip-melzacki) - *Polish* - [6.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-the-outer-worlds-2-druga-czesc-to-to-samo-tylko-drozej/za4868)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [90 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Alexandre Galvão](https://opencritic.com/critic/7692/alexandre-galv-o) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/10/analise-review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameOnly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/912/gameonly)** - [Michał Marasek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10763/micha-marasek) - *Polish* - [7 / 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGJFEOrYujM&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[GamePro](https://opencritic.com/outlet/488/gamepro)** - [Maximilian Franke](https://opencritic.com/critic/5932/maximilian-franke) - *German* - [80 / 100](https://www.gamepro.de/artikel/the-outer-worlds-2-test,3441627.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Steve Watts](https://opencritic.com/critic/276/steve-watts) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-just-as-good-the-second-time-around/1900-6418428/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 imbues Obsidian's spacefaring RPG series with its own identity, letting you bumble your way through corporate and cultish intrigue in space.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameblog](https://opencritic.com/outlet/450/gameblog)** - *French* - [8 / 10](\n        https://www.gameblog.fr/jeu-video/jeux/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2-pc-704369)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Rudy Wijnberg](https://opencritic.com/critic/7467/rudy-wijnberg) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-puike-satire-en-kosmische-chaos/5637-30-1-5)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a bold, darkly funny sci-fi RPG that builds on its predecessor with richer worlds, sharper combat, and true player freedom—though a clunky interface and minor bugs keep it from perfection.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamepressure](https://opencritic.com/outlet/870/gamepressure)** - [Matt Buckley](https://opencritic.com/critic/495/matt-buckley) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-finding-value-in-the-flaws/ze7a6)\n\n>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Blaine Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/5094/blaine-smith) - [95 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian Entertainment's best work to date - a perfect RPG for those seeking an old-school approach, one with more substance than expanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesFinest](https://opencritic.com/outlet/683/gamesfinest)** - [Luca Pernecker](https://opencritic.com/critic/10581/luca-pernecker) - *German* - [8 / 10](https://gamesfinest.de/tests/test-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - Matt Bianucci - [9 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-prudent-experience)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a more expansive, more choice-heavy, and more satisfying western RPG that stands above most of its recent peers.\n\n-------------\n\n**[HCL.hr](https://opencritic.com/outlet/931/hcl-hr)** - [Zoran Žalac](https://opencritic.com/critic/10938/zoran-alac) - *Unknown* - [86 / 100](https://www.hcl.hr/recenzija/the-outer-worlds-2-233552/)\n\n>Finally, a proper RPG with action elements, not just an action game with role-playing features. The Outer Worlds 2 showcases impressive narrative adaptability to player choices, lacking only a bit of technical ambition and polish to rank among the best role-playing games of today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Kyuman Kim](https://opencritic.com/critic/9273/kyuman-kim) - *Korean* - [8.2 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=310629)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 showcases Obsidian's RPG mastery through meaningful choices and dynamic character building, though the world lacks the vibrancy of modern open-world games.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Just Play it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/936/just-play-it)** - [Aimen TAIB](https://opencritic.com/critic/10987/aimen-taib) - *Arabic* - [7.5 / 10](https://justplayit.info/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it’s undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Mick Fraser](https://opencritic.com/critic/572/mick-fraser) - [9 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deceptively smart Looter-shooter RPG with colourful worlds and entertaining characters, and some really satisfying, malleable combat.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MondoXbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/794/mondoxbox)** - [Giuseppe Genga](https://opencritic.com/critic/7638/giuseppe-genga) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.mondoxbox.com/recensione/3825/the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience. However, it unfortunately falters in its narrative, with a lackluster story and unconvincing companions that fail to engage, leaving a technically proficient but less inspired adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MonsterVine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/334/monstervine)** - [Joe Bariso](https://opencritic.com/critic/7475/joe-bariso) - [3.5 / 5](https://monstervine.com/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a serviceable RPG held back from greatness by playing it too safe and small. Too afraid to alienate players and make big swings like the setting deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nexus Hub](https://opencritic.com/outlet/528/nexus-hub)** - [Andrew Logue](https://opencritic.com/critic/3996/andrew-logue) - [8 / 10](https://nexushub.co.za/nexus/review-the-outer-worlds-2.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 proves if it ain’t broke, make it bigger and prettier - a solid sequel that expands upon the first game in meaningful ways, though some fans might experience a bit of déjà vu.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Vincent Ternida](https://opencritic.com/critic/8412/vincent-ternida) - [8 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2025/10/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PPE.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/642/ppe-pl)** - [Patryk Dzięglewicz](https://opencritic.com/critic/8235/patryk-dzi-glewicz) - *Polish* - [8 / 10](https://www.ppe.pl/recenzje/387599/the-outer-worlds-2-recenzja-gry-chciwosc-kontra-totalitaryzm.html)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Pizza Fria](https://opencritic.com/outlet/915/pizza-fria)** - [Leandro Felippe de Paiva Gomes](https://opencritic.com/critic/10798/leandro-felippe-de-paiva-gomes) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 10](https://pizzafria.ig.com.br/analises/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Timothy Nunes](https://opencritic.com/critic/846/timothy-nunes) - [9 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-ps5/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/the-outer-worlds-2)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - [Peter Dragula](https://opencritic.com/critic/5091/peter-dragula) - *Slovak* - [8 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40251/the-outer-worlds-2.htm)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Saving Content](https://opencritic.com/outlet/338/saving-content)** - [Scott Ellison II](https://opencritic.com/critic/2142/scott-ellison-ii) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.savingcontent.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Luis Avilés](https://opencritic.com/critic/6369/luis-avil-s) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/10/23/review-the-outer-worlds-2-all-systems-go/)\n\n>Refined in every single way, The Outer Worlds 2 is not simply a better sequel: it’s the new gold standard in the narrative FPS genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Sirus Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/409/sirus-gaming)** - [Kurt John Palomaria](https://opencritic.com/critic/5838/kurt-john-palomaria) - [9 / 10](https://sirusgaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/the-outer-worlds-2-recensione)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stevivor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/424/stevivor)** - [Matt Gosper](https://opencritic.com/critic/2949/matt-gosper) - [8.5 / 10](https://stevivor.com/reviews/the-outer-worlds-2-review-new-and-improved/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is more of everything I liked before in The Outer Worlds, but dialled up to 110% - just like a new and improved offering from Auntie’s Choice!\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Ashley Erickson](https://opencritic.com/critic/9829/ashley-erickson) - [7.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>While there's little wrong with The Outer Worlds 2, it doesn't have a pull that will keep players wanting to devote hours to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Beta Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/844/the-beta-network)** - [Anthony Culinas](https://opencritic.com/critic/8928/anthony-culinas) - [7 / 10](https://thebetanetwork.net/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Gareth Chadwick](https://opencritic.com/critic/317/gareth-chadwick) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Too Much Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/622/too-much-gaming)** - [Carlos Hernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/5134/carlos-hernandez) - [4 / 5](https://www.toomuchgaming.net/blog-news/the-outer-worlds-2-review)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/10/23/reviews/148036-xbox-series-x-review-the-outer-worlds-2/)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a solid, engaging and enjoyable follow-up to the original game. It changes its dynamic and tone enough that it can potentially turn off people who really loved the original. At the same time, it feels like something that might work better for those who prefer their RPGs to be less goofy. There's a varied and interesting set of character builds available, and it's easy to imagine playing the game multiple times to see distinctly different outcomes for various quests. If you're looking for a solid RPG with some good meat on its bones, The Outer Worlds 2 does everything it needs to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[XDA](https://opencritic.com/outlet/967/xda)** - [Tomas Franzese](https://opencritic.com/critic/2097/tomas-franzese) - [9 / 10](https://www.xda-developers.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review-xbox/)\n\n>It's an expertly written, socially relevant RPG about how those with wealth and power will constantly fight over control of others, even as the universe tears itself apart. Its skills and perks aren't afraid to impact your playthrough in ultra-specific ways, and its hand-crafted planets ensure the entirety of the adventure is memorable.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Xbox Achievements](https://opencritic.com/outlet/152/xbox-achievements)** - [Dan Webb](https://opencritic.com/critic/681/dan-webb) - [80%](https://www.xboxachievements.com/game/the-outer-worlds-2/review/)\n\n>The release of The Outer Worlds in 2019 was one of those occasions where a game totally blindsided me. I knew Obsidian was a solid studio, but TOW, ...\n\n-------------\n\n**[XboxEra](https://opencritic.com/outlet/758/xboxera)** - [Jesse Norris](https://opencritic.com/critic/7583/jesse-norris) - [9 / 10](https://xboxera.com/?p=146032)\n\n>The Outer Worlds 2 is a confidently made game. It is perfectly-scoped, with excellent gameplay, writing, and voice acting. The combat and movement are the biggest step up over the original. Whether you have played that title or not, if you want a choice-heavy, narrative-rich adventure in a far-off solar system, then this game is worth a download or Game Pass, or buying outright.\n\n-------------",

    "selftext": "Electronic Arts, the gaming giant behind games like The Sims, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield franchise, today announced a new partnership with Stability AI that it claims will help artists more quickly iterate and develop games more efficiently. However, according to a recent report by Business Insider, EA has been pushing its employees across the board to use AI for at least a year. Sources who spoke to Business Insider revealed that, despite what EA says about any AI tools it plans to develop with Stability AI in the future, the current in-house AI tools have caused more hassle than anything else. EA employees familiar with the AI tools say that the AI tools often hallucinate, to the point that developers have to go in and manually fix code that the AI tools generated.  \n  \nArtists also took issue with the fact that their art was being used to train these AI models, which would theoretically devalue their work and result in reduced demand for artists. There are also reports that around 100 employees were recently terminated from the QA department because the AI could easily review and summarize tester feedback. Despite these complaints, EA is leaning into AI more heavily than ever with the aforementioned Stability AI partnership. News also just broke that Krafton, the publisher behind PUBG and the Subnautica franchise, has announced that it will be pivoting to become an AI-first company. Specifically, Krafton will be spending $70 million on GPU horsepower to power an increased reliance on agentic AI for automation and efficiency. Towards the end of September, it was revealed that EA's new owners—a group of investors—would be leaning on AI in order to \"significantly cut operating costs,\" which has clearly already started to materialize.  \n",

Later in the day, I received two pictures showing a homeless guy sleeping in my bed, with two cops standing over him. The only reason I believed them was because I was busy at work and didn’t bother to double-check the images. It didn’t help that someone actually tried using my card today, so I had to talk to the bank about that. On my way home, I read the comments on my previous post, and someone pointed out the shadow of a monitor in my room. Puzzled by that observation, I decided to take a closer look at the photo. If you look at the photo showing everything that was supposedly taken, you can see my headset on the chair and my controller sitting on its stand. There’s also an outlet on the left side with a cord running between the plugs.\n\nAnyway, everyone who thought it was fake was right. Whoever pointed out the shadow of my monitor really helped me take a closer look at the images.",

I say odd since it only happens under a very specific circumstance; tabbing out of intensive games. It's completely silent otherwise. I've tested it on low, medium, and high intensity games, but have only heard it once I tab out of something with a high load. I'm thinking it's just something hitting or rattling inside the fan, but wouldn't I hear it regardless of speed? That's what's making me worry. Hoping someone here can help me out since Micro Center is 2 hours away and I'd like to save a trip if possible. PSU is a Corsair RM1000e if that helps at all.",

So i told him he could send me the money over time as he could afford (this build is very much a budget build) and id build him the pc for him. Well initially when i put together the listed i quoted him for a cheap case, he said he didn't care too much to pay extra for the looks well i decided to take the 60$ he sent for the case and invest it into his gpu to upgrade the choices he had for that and that i would pay for a nice case to really elevate his first pc to something he will love.  So what are your recommendations for nice cases? I always tend to lean towards the O11 or the H9 but I'm open to whatever as long as its not stupid crazy expensive.\n\nTLDR: Surprising my brother with a nice case for his first pc, help me pick one out.",

Depending on what app or tab is open, the pixels will take on the same colour ( as you can see with the white google tab). This has been an ongoing issue for a while now but what’s interesting is that it changes based on what my refresh rate is set to. \n\nFor example, when I initially faced this problem I was on 165hz.  It starts with a feint line right at the bottom, barely noticeable. Even as it increases in size, it typically only shows fresh on startup, but after 10 minutes it disappears, back to normal. Eventually it becomes permanent. Over time it grows larger and rises up all the way to the centre of the monitor. \n\nHowever, when I lowered my refresh rate to 144hz, the issue went away. Of course, after some time 144hz began to act the same way. This cycle kept repeating leading me to current day where I have it at 120hz. I’m sure if I tried to switch back to 165hz my entire screen would be fully blacked out.\n\nWhat is the issue, and if so, is it fixable? Or do I just need to replace my monitor? Thanks\n\nFYI - At no point in the past have I punched my monitor in a fit of rage, so I don’t believe its down to damage.",

I'm mostly worried about air flow, power draw and monitor performance.\n\nLink : [https://newegg.io/3c2935f](https://newegg.io/3c2935f)  \nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D  \nMotherboard: GIGABYTE X870E AORUS PRO ICE AM5 LGA 1718  \nMemory: G.SKILL Trident Z5 Royal Neo Series 32GB (2 x 16GB)  \nGraphics Cards: SAPPHIRE PURE Radeon RX 9070 XT 16GB GDDR6  \nCase: HYTE Y70 touch infinite Snow White  \nPower Supply: LIAN LI Edge series EG1000 White, 1000W  \nStorage: SAMSUNG SSD 9100 PRO 2TB, PCIe 5.0x4  \nCPU Cooler: LIAN LI Galahad II LCD SL-INF 360 White Liquid Cooler  \nAccessories: LIAN LI UNI FAN SL INFINITY 140 RGB WHITE  \nAccessories: 2 x LIAN LI UNI FAN SL INFINITY 120 RGB WHITE 3 PCS PACK L Connect 3.0 Controller included\n\n**Airflow plan:**  \nBottom + side intake  \nRear + top exhaust  \nIs my planned airflow configuration optimal for cooling these components?\n\n**Monitor choice:**  \nEither keep Dual 27” 1440p  \nOr upgrade to Odyssey G9 49” 5120x1440  \nIf i choose to upgrade my monitor, does the refresh rate affect the performance of the 9070XT? Odyssey OLED G9 G93SC (240HZ) vs G93SD (144HZ)\n\nLastly, will a 1000W PSU comfortably handle this build? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

    "subreddit": "pcmasterrace",
    "title": "5090 at x8 PCIe 5.0 vs x16 PCIe 5.0 Lanes",
    "selftext": "Long story short, the last 6 months I became a PC gaming nerd. I always knew PC basics from college (Word, simple editing, coding) So the PC world always seemed self explanatory when looking into an unknown area. Always loved gaming, but also a console gamer. After 6 years of wanting the pull the trigger, I went all out and bought & made what I thought would be the best PC possible (Mainly for 1440p to 4k gaming, and benchmarks for fun) I have the Asus 870E WiFi 7 gaming MOTO. Seems to be able to run the ram, CPU, GPU at full speed, and loved the awesome array of high speed USB slots.\n\nHowever, after time went on after I assembled my PC, I started to expand my storage more (do a lot of video editing, and need a lot of space, also have a ton of games & like the idea of having what I want to play already downloaded) I learned that using the On the MOTO, there are 3 PCIE Gen 5 slots, and if you populate 2 of them (either M.2\\_2 or M.2\\_3) then it brings the GPU lanes down to x8 from x16. I immediately thought half my performance would be gone, and at best some kind of compromise. I did a ton of research and did not find any concrete results for what id use my PC for (Mainly gaming) & the idea of sending thousands to cap my gpu for some extra storage was not a compromise I was willing to make. But I also heard that you would only see a difference if you were doping things like Ultra-high-res streaming 8K+ at 60Hz with AI upscaling, Professional GPU acceleration (CUDA/RTX rendering farms), VR at extreme settings (Index @ 4K + eye tracking) etc. I heard gaming would take a 1% hit at most. So, I decide to test the results myself.\n\nI compared x16 vs. x8 while playing Hogwarts Legacy 4k native with max settings/ray tracing, and the same with doom dark ages and cyberpunk. I tested every game and test 3 times each, and round out the average (the average of each identical test was less than 0.1%)\n\nI also tested on Userbenchmark (I know people hate it, but it test each companant, gives benchmarks for each) and 3dmark.\n\nIll list the link of the x16 vs. x8 results. Quick answer, the x8 & x16 performed identical in every game in every mode. And in synthetic benchmarks the x8 performed slightly better. Apparently the only reason for this is that x8 config likely performed better because it let you use more Gen 5 and Gen 4 SSDs at once, maximizing storage bandwidth. There's also reduced lane contention between GPU and SSDs, and lower chipset/misc VRM stress since those stages could be better balanced in the x8 scenario.\n\nJust wanted this info out there to say, If your using your 5090 for very demanding gaming, going from x16 to x8 (at least for me) will NOT hurt performance at all.\n\n\n\nMy setup for reference\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D (Overclocked to 5.5 GHz)\n\nGPU: Gigabyte RTX 5090 Gaming OC 32 GB (Overclocked to 2895 MHz)\n\nMotherboard: ASUS ROG Strix X870E‑E Gaming WiFi\n\nRAM: G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 48 GB DDR5‑6000 CL26\n\nPSU: MSI MPG A1250GS  1250 W  80+ Gold  ATX 3.1\n\nCooler: Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 420 A‑RGB\n\nCase: NZXT H9 Flow RGB (white 2025 model)\n\nM.2\\_1 (CPU Gen 5 slot): WD Black SN8100 4 TB Gen 5 NVMe\n\nM.2\\_2 (one of the slots that brings the GPU lanes down to x8): WD Black SN8100 4 TB Gen 5 NVMe\n\nM.2\\_4: Samsung 990 PRO 4 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe\n\nM.2\\_5: Samsung 990 PRO 4 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe\n\nWi‑Fi Card: MSI Herald‑BE Wi‑Fi 7 MAX\n\nI don't know If I had the M.2\\_3 slot filled if that would bring down any performance\n\n\n\nThe actual results\n\n  \n**Condensed Results: x16 vs x8 PCIe 5.0 (UserBenchmark)**\n\n**x16 lanes (Gen 5):**\n\n* GPU Score: **218%**\n* SSD (WD SN8100) Write: **8,818 MB/s**\n* **GPU 218%**\n\n**x8 lanes (Gen 5):**\n\n* GPU Score: **217%**\n* SSD (WD SN8100) Write: **9,147 MB/s**\n* GPU 217%\n\n**Key Takeaway:**\n\n* GPU scores: **Virtually identical**\n* Storage: **x8 config allows both Gen 5 SSDs peak speed**\n* System percentile: **x8 config ranked higher**\n* x8 gave me better overall speed to multiple gen 5 SSD's thanks to unconstrained SSDs (apparently), with no GPU loss.\n\n\n\nThe x16 link to results: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/71163876](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/71163876)\n\nThe x8 link to results: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/71515445](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/71515445)\n\n",

    "selftext": "I haven't gamed for a while due to work, and updated my GPU in the meantime. For the first time in a while I booted up some games, and my fans were going crazy on Overwatch 2. 5950x, MSI 5090, Fractal Meshify 2 Case, Noctua D15 G1 cooler, all Noctua fans. 144hz 4K refresh.\n\nI was surprised to see CPU at mid 80s C gaming as IIRC I used to always be in the 70s. Maybe it's a combination of the 5090 running hotter than the 4090? Maybe my thermal paste is getting old (5 years) on the 5950x?\n\nIs this typical? I thought Overwatch 2 was pretty lightweight on the CPU. But the 5090 also runs around 67C here vs the 4090 which IIRC was much cooler, so maybe it's causing everything to heat up more.\n\nOn the other hand, I've noticed temp spikes even on Youtube to mid 70s on Chrome despite having hardware GPU acceleration on. Not sure why my CPU seems to suddenly be running warmer?",

I had this problem for more than 2 years now and it really sucked because after 2h gaming sessions I might either get a blue screen or a game crash (or both). \n\nAnyway I had a tech friend over that does fixing like this for a living and he tested everything. Figured my fan curve might be the problem. He then adjusted the fan curve by 10% on all 3 values that were not in Zero mode. \n\nWe stress tested it and it didnt crash since. He told me my cooling system might have a defect and this increased the temps up to 100°C on hotspot and GCD. He also told me if it comes back I should either try to find someone that fixes these (because he doesnt) or just buy a new one.\n\nMaybe you got the same issue and this post might help you.",

While I am a hard linux lover, I realistically need bare metal windows for some of my research projects. \n\nSo, after 8 long years I decided to upgrade, I am choosing an i9-10940X. Yes, I know it is over priced but I had one constraint I wanted to get right: I run 256 gb of ram due to the virtual machines I sometimes need. And I didn’t have the cash for a thread ripper. \n\nThis is the first time I do a major upgrade to my computer, feels exciting and nostalgic. I guess I will build a second desktop with my old mob, cpu and the components I have upgraded from my first build over the years. Feels a bit like the ship of theseus",

DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

Its had a new power supply, new graphics card, 3 generations of windows operating systems (including a few janky OS repairs), 4 new RAM cards, 2 new HD drives and 1 new SD drive. Its physically too old to be upgradable to future windows OS and has lived the latter part of its life overheating and struggling to boot like the geriatric it is.\n\nIt kept me in touch with friends during the early days of Facebook, it helped me study, it helped me research and budget my way through university, it brought me joy through gaming into the early hours of the morning, its seen me through financial jams and job interviews, its made custom birthday cards and played movies. It has done its duty and then some, and no one can deny that.\n\nBut the time has finally come. A few weeks ago it stopped booting entirely, powering nothing but the fans in its last gasp. Its death rattle. Ive done everything I can for it but its had enough. Its time to do one last hard shutdown. Time to finally let it rest and start a new.\n\nBe at peace you absolute champion.",

    "title": "Bee wanting a Liquid cooled GPU for a decade. Finally did it.",
    "selftext": "*I don’t want to come off as a bragging asshole, never wanted or thought I’d get a 5090, nor an Astral, I’ve always used my old PC parts and cases even though they never looked the peak (old NZXT case, Cheapest Variants of gpus and motherboards ect). But I always told myself the next build I did was going to be exactly how I wanted.*\n\nAfter my 4090 melted, I was able to get a full refund after 3 years of ownership. I was really hoping that thing would last me a decade. I found out from friends that you can buy the microcenter extended warrantee and return your GPU no questions asked whenever you want, most people do this when the new ones come out. Since the 50 series has already been out a year, I figured this would be my stopgap until the 60 series. I’ve always wanted a Water-cooled, but never wanted to build my own, especially with it being harder and more expensive than ever. Was really nervous how everything would fit and plug in and man I’m shocked how easy this is. \n\n5090 ROG Astral LC has no other connections required other than power. You simply plug it into the PCIE and power cable and that’s it. The fans are built in and wired into the Radiator, and everything’s run off the PCIE. I was so Suprised, I thought I’d be needing to use extra fan headers or AIO headers at a minimum. Everything ran through asus software. Extremely pleased with how much space I had as well. The NZXT H9 Flow with the angled fans (2025 model) is game changing. Coming from an old NXZT H710i, it’s crazy how huge cases like that seem so incredibly small and cramped these days. \n\nHumble brag but I feel like with this layout this is one of the most streamline interiors I’ve seen, the tubes fit extremely well along side the left of the case, and it’s one of the few builds ive seen where 2 radiators don’t look hideous. I wired the power through the top to give my capture card some space. (Capture card is why I didn’t mount GPU vertically, although i do like the look, and might later) but for now I’m loving this build. ",

    "selftext": "I built my first pc 8 years ago, with an intel i7-6850K. \n\nI am a casual gamer so I mostly built it for development and security research (I run a lot of vms sometimes).  \n\nMicrosoft forced me, like many people, to upgrade my Hardware so I could run Windows 11. While I am a hard linux lover, I realistically need bare metal windows for some of my research projects. \n\nSo, after 8 long years I decided to upgrade, I am choosing an i9-10940X. Yes, I know it is over priced but I had one constraint I wanted to get right: I run 256 gb of ram due to the virtual machines I sometimes need. And I didn’t have the cash for a thread ripper. \n\nThis is the first time I do a major upgrade to my computer, feels exciting and nostalgic. I guess I will build a second desktop with my old mob, cpu and the components I have upgraded from my first build over the years. Feels a bit like the ship of theseus",

    "selftext": "The culprit was a software bug in DynamoDB, AWS' DNS management system. DNS or \"Domain Name System\" is often analogized as the phone book of the internet, translating domain names preferred by human users into the IP addresses required by automated systems. On the modern internet, many services, such as cloud computing or streaming, need to be able to assign the same domain to multiple IP addresses in a network, allowing efficient use of geographically distributed servers.\n\n  \nDNS Enactor, a component of DynamoDB responsible for updating these tables, \"experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints.\" While Enactor played catch-up, DynamoDB continued generating new plans for it to follow, which another, on-time DNS Enactor helpfully tried to implement.\n\n  \nThe fresh DNS configuration that resulted was overwritten by a significantly outdated one when the delayed Enactor finally caught up, bypassing a safeguard meant to prevent just such an error which was also experiencing delays. The second, on-time Enactor then deleted the outdated plan altogether, detecting that it was stale. This state of affairs resulted in knock on effects across AWS, requiring engineers to manually diagnose the problem and resolve it.",

Its had a new power supply, new graphics card, 3 generations of windows operating systems (including a few janky OS repairs), 4 new RAM cards, 2 new HD drives and 1 new SD drive. Its physically too old to be upgradable to future windows OS and has lived the latter part of its life overheating and struggling to boot like the geriatric it is.\n\nIt kept me in touch with friends during the early days of Facebook, it helped me study, it helped me research and budget my way through university, it brought me joy through gaming into the early hours of the morning, its seen me through financial jams and job interviews, its made custom birthday cards and played movies. It has done its duty and then some, and no one can deny that.\n\nBut the time has finally come. A few weeks ago it stopped booting entirely, powering nothing but the fans in its last gasp. Its death rattle. Ive done everything I can for it but its had enough. Its time to do one last hard shutdown. Time to finally let it rest and start a new.\n\nBe at peace you absolute champion.",

Added riser under monitor\n2. Added keybo/mouse pad (my old one, ordered new one to test)\n3. Added a power shelf under the table on the right\n4. FIXED the monitor tilt, more cable management, tucked computer away behind bar\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n\n1. Waiting on new shelf and plants.\n2. Ordered a pegboard as well for charging station\n3. New larger grey scale mouse pad\n4. Headphones modern stand coming in Monday\n\nThank you all for the recommendations and trolling :P was fun!  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Original Post  \nFinally got around revamping my work station.\n\n* Used the [74\" IKEA Kitchen KIRBY Walnut Veneer Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/karlby-countertop-for-kitchen-island-walnut-veneer-30297641/#content)\n* Got a welder to custom build legs for me\n* Bought square leg risers to add some height + have padding on the bottom of the feet.\n* Added LED lights from Temu\n* Cable management under the monitor area via Amazon\n* Monitor arm from Amazon as well\n* Yamaha HS7 Monitor + Amazon Stands (I wish the stands were shorter but the smaller ones couldn't handle the weight)\n\nMy computer is tucked in the back under, it doesnt stick out...just an early picture ( I built without lights for the first time thinking I wouldn't care lol, wish I got a sick case, but oh well)\n\nWaiting for blackfriday to get a new chair as the current one is too old.\n\nI wanted to add shelving so I bought one but not sure where to add it lol.

    "selftext": "The base was a Keychron V1 Max\n\nThe whole concept came from those doodles we used to draw on the edges of our school notebooks — band names, quotes, random sketches, everything that once (and still) shaped who I am.  \nOnce I started, I ran out of space way too fast 🙂.\n\nI had one rule: only include things that inspire me — in one way or another, something positive. So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Early review of the ND104",
    "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI subscribed the Meletrix newsletter long ago (and actually read it). In one I found the passage reading: we give away  some of the ND104 to members of our community. I wrote them and was lucky to be one of the people getting a version of it. So here is my review (also including from which keyboards I come). \n\nI use the ND104 both for work and gaming — especially for titles like League of Legends or Dune: Awakening. I already own another mechanical keyboard (the Zoom98), but what always put me off about mechanical keyboards was the whole assembly process. I built my Zoom98 together with a friend because I didn’t trust myself to do it alone — I just didn’t have the confidence or that “builder’s touch.” That’s actually why I came quite late to the custom keyboard hobby. I started out with a used Zoom75, which I also got from that same friend who helped me with my first build.\n\nSo when I found out about the ND104, I was honestly thrilled — especially because it was available through Kickstarter and came pre-assembled. When you first hold the packaging, you immediately get that solid, premium feel. And that impression continues through the entire unboxing and setup: taking it out, plugging it in, and hitting those first keys.\n\nThe sound is satisfying but not too loud — perfect for office use. I’ve taken it with me to work for several days now; it’s definitely heavy in the backpack, but absolutely worth it. Typing simply feels great.\n\nI also love the color and the lighting effects — they look fantastic without being over the top. The little display that shows which keys you’re pressing is a fun and surprisingly useful touch. I didn’t expect to enjoy that feature so much, but I really do.\n\nConnectivity-wise, it’s excellent: I use USB-C for my gaming PC and Bluetooth for my work laptop, and switching between them works flawlessly.\n\nFor its price and build quality, the ND104 is an outstanding keyboard — especially if you’ve always been hesitant about building a custom one yourself. It comes ready out of the box but still delivers that luxurious, mechanical typing experience. A fantastic keyboard overall. Before owning a Zoom, I used to by the high end models from a company starting with L and ending with tech. They don’t come close to the ND104 (and the Zoom). That is why I think the price tag for the ND104 is so good. \n\nI also baked the iso version of the keyboard and I am very eager to update this post (or make a new one) after this version arrives in the future. \n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/wzb2GPh\n\nLeobog Hi75c Pro (stock except for keycaps and switches)  \nOsume Night Market keycaps  \nMMD Princess v4 linear switches (stock)  \n[Sound test but does NOT do it justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OokIrbbHVDw)\n\nI was out of the hobby for years until my friend told me about how much they loved their new Leobog Hi75. \nFirst off, I have to say the game has evolved in the past 5 years or so, offering many outstanding stock budget models you previously would have to spend hundreds to replicate. Big win for us all!\n\nI'm a big fan of marbley sounds and the Hi75 is the perfect model for this. Even stock, this thing sounded great.\nI tried HMX Canglan switches on this board, which sounded great but had a more muted and thocky sound. I was pleasantly surprised by the MMD Princesses which had a slightly higher-pitched sound, which I think really helps with the marbley sound as opposed to a more deep and flat sound. I was inspired by sound tests like [this one with MMD Princesses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/o2iPPrgfkIo) and [this one with Epomaker Jade Blossoms](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y9EoDIbE9OU) which sound basically perfect to me. The former is more like what my build sounds like IRL so I'm over the moon with the sound, but I still have Jade Blossoms on the way to see what they sound like as well.\n\nI'm also pleasantly surprised by these Osume keycaps. Not only do I like the non-standard legends and gradient colors from top to bottom, the packaging itself was very thoughtful (all rows separated in different trays, and individual places in the trays labeled, as opposed to all keycaps in one enormous tray with no labeling to help). And of course as a Taiwanese guy, I loved these novelties and had to spring for those as well. :)\n\nOverall this is the most perfect build I've ever made and I'm so happy with what the market looks like in 2025.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

    "selftext": "TLDR: Found bigger silicone bumpons that dont sink into deskpads completely, fixing “thudding”. input parts number 107091 into [Here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/), order a reasonable amount and should deliver it to you for free\n\n\nNowadays I’ve been noticing that some keyboards like the Frog Mini and some if the newer Neo boards having issues with how it sounds. This is mostly due to those keyboards having pretty short feet leading to the bottom of the keyboard to touch your deskpad as it compresses due to the weight of the keyboard which causes it to “thud”. \n\nI’ve had issues with this in the past since I use a XSoft mousepad from LethalGamingGear. When i put my keyboard on my mousepad it at first sounds fine, but as the keyboard starts to sink down due to its weight, i start to hear vibrations and “thudding” from the desk.\n\nWhile building a drawer from ikea, i noticed that it came with some silicone bumpons to reduce the noise from the contact of the wood. And now compared to the normal hemisphere silicone bumpons that keyboards usually come with, these are a bit bigger. So I thought to try them on a keyboard that is thudding, and to my surprise it worked perfectly, tall enough so that the bottom does not touch my mousepad. I did some searching to see where i can find more of these and lo and behold, ikea actually gives them for free. Simply go to the [IKEA spare parts](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/returns-claims/spareparts/) website and input part number 107091 and it should show up. Each one comes in a pack of 2 so as long as you order a reasonable amount, they should give them to you for free delivered straight to you.\n\nEDIT: Size for comparison. Smaller original feet are from a JJW Moment https://imgur.com/a/T48CUmH",

You can also print the [case](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-macropad-case?variant=48199679443184) and [keycaps](https://scottokeebs.com/products/scottofrog-keycaps) yourself if you have the ability to / don't want to purchase them.\n\nI have done many streams and videos on the original handwired version but plan on releasing a video for this one soon over on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/joe_scotto).\n\nIf you have any questions, please do ask... this board is really neat and honestly not all that hard to use.

After opening the box, you're greeted with a well designed & packed, beautiful board. I was unsure which model color combo I got, but after opening I was greeted by a futuristic cyberpunk surprise as the green and purple model hit my eyes like a truck. It's vibrant. \n\nI turned the board over in my hands, noticing the absence of any rattling or “movement”, no sharp edges to slice or poke from the metal accents on the top case. \n\nThe included keycaps definitely fit the vibe of the whole board, but to my fading eyes the legends are reeeeeaaalllly hard to see if you're not a touch-typer. \n\nThe keycap design is just a bit too busy with the styling of the case and would look better with more minimalist styling (in my opinion). If that's your vibe, don't let me yuck your yum!  I'll definitely be changing them to a monochrome set soon that matches with the color scheme. \n\nUsing the board:\n\nI wanted to put this board through its paces so I used it at work for a solid week as a daily driver experimenting with layouts and HE switches. Chilkey actually included the stock custom “clacky” WS Flux HE switches as well as the “deep clacky” WS Flux HE switches. They are exactly what they are described. You can quote me on this; these are the best sounding HE switches I've ever used. Whether you like a higher pitch clack or lower pitch marbly clack, these switches are leaps and bounds in sound and I praise Chilkey for choosing these. \n\nAs I used it, I got compliments on the sound. It just sounds good!  If you've never tried an HE (Hall Effect) board, you can customize actuation while also adding multiple triggers tied to whatever you want to in your games. It just works. \n\nThe LED accents on the front, sides, and PCB are mesmerizing. Beautifully executed. \n\nI don't wanna wax poetic, but I'll wrap this up with saying that if you want a stylish one-of-a-kind cyberpunk splash on your desk, definitely pick this one up for yourself. It comes in purple or red (pick red for awesome Iron Man vibes). \n\nI get no compensation for this review nor discount codes for a kick of a percentage of a sale. This is just me giving you my thoughts. I'll see y'all on the flippity flip!  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I am currently rearranging my desk and I wanted to share my three keyboards! All are connected to my PC at the same time (don’t ask) and I just grab one depending on what I’m doing for the day. I love all three for different reasons and wanted to share. \n\n1. I first bought the Akko Mu01 and put kitty ear keycaps on the top row. I use this one to game and it also is Bluetooth connected to my work laptop for remote days. \n\n2. I fell in love with the Akko bun wonderland keycaps but didn’t want to type on buns all the time and know I would never switch them back and forth so I got the Leobog Hi75 and the buns live there. I keep the backlight red so it looks like they are in the oven! Sounds amazing and looks adorable! \n\n3. I had been eyeing the Lofree dot foundation keyboard for about a year and was going to get it for myself for Christmas but then they released the lipstick edition. As a hardcore makeup girly and beauty YouTuber, having two of my interests collide was an easy sell to me! I bought the bundle with the number pad/ calculator. I just unboxed it and it is beautiful! \n\nAs my keyboard stand only holds three keyboards, I’m done!! 😊\n\nLet me know what you think!! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nA flat typing surface is not very comfortable. Most keyboards solve this problem by using profiled keycaps that form the general shape of a curve. However, achieving a curved typing surface by angling the keycap faces has flaws:  \n\n* The direction your finger pushes is not exactly in line with the direction the key moves. This means:\n   * Some of your force does not contribute to pushing the key, requiring you to push harder.\n   * Some of your force gets turned into friction, making the switch feel scratchier and requiring you to push even harder.\n* The angled keycaps need to be taller, resulting in more horizontal leverage and amplifying the above negative effects.\n\nIn Curve0, the switches themselves are at an angle to achieve the desired typing surface without any compromises.\n\n# Interest check\n\nCheck out the [geekhack post](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=125898) for more information",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm posting this as a warning to anyone considering buying from Geistmaschine, and also to see if anyone else is in the same situation.\n\nI placed order with them back on **March 26, 2025**. It is now late October, and my order status is still \"Unfulfilled.\"\n\nTo follow up, I sent an email to their customer support on **October 15th** to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nI also sent them a message on Instagram on **October 19th**. The account has been \"online\" multiple times since I sent it, but they are deliberately ignoring my message.\n\nI recently sent an email to their customer support to cancel the order and request a full refund, but I have received no reply.\n\nAfter getting no response, I did a search and found this thread, which seems to confirm the worst: [Geistmaschine appears to be defunct/exit scamming](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1mq742g/geistmaschine_appears_to_be_defunctexit_scamming/)\n\nAt this point, I'm assuming the company is gone and has taken the money. Has anyone else had a similar experience with them recently?",

    "selftext": "### Hey /r/MechanicalKeyboards. Hope you are all doing well. \n\nWe've noticed an uptick in spam in the past few months that have necessitated a couple rule changes. [As always please refer to the rules before posting, but I've detailed changes below.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/subreddit_rules)  \n\n___\n\n**Media Posts**\n\nDue to a heavy increase of bot posts, we are no longer allowing media only posts. We ask contributers to provide context to your media posts with relevant information. Why are you posting the content? Do you find it cool, did you get a great shot of your board, or maybe you just want to show off your work. As a reminder there are two image based flairs, Builds and Photos. Builds do require information regarding the keyboard, the minimum being the components you used. Preferably we'd like some context around the build as well, why did you pick those components, is there anything you'd change looking back. More context leads to better discussion. We do prefer `Builds` posts over `Photos` posts because they tend to lead to more discussion. \n\n___\n\n**Typing Apps and Extensions**\n\nWe've made the decision to no longer allow the promotion of typing applications, games, and extensions. We've seen an uptick in the number of promotion posts for these types of related services. We've found that many times, these types of applications or extensions collect user data. In an age where digital privacy is incredibly important, we don't feel comfortable allowing their promotion at this time. **We'd like to remind users to be aware of what permissions extensions and applications have to your data, be informed about what they are collecting and how they are using it.** \n\n___\n\nWe have also noticed that many brands are offering free products in exchange for reviews. While we never want to outright silence reviews, we are looking into how this type of content is handled. We've seen an increase in lower effort reviews that serve solely as an avenue to receive free product and advertise for a brand outside the promotional rules limits. We also want to ensure that reviewers that take the time to educate potential buyers on positive and negative aspects of products aren't being punished for receiving products in exchange for their hard work. It's a fine line and it's not always clear where that line should be drawn, but know that it's something that the moderation team is looking at.",

    "title": "Early review of the ND104",
    "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nI subscribed the Meletrix newsletter long ago (and actually read it). In one I found the passage reading: we give away  some of the ND104 to members of our community. I wrote them and was lucky to be one of the people getting a version of it. So here is my review (also including from which keyboards I come). \n\nI use the ND104 both for work and gaming — especially for titles like League of Legends or Dune: Awakening. I already own another mechanical keyboard (the Zoom98), but what always put me off about mechanical keyboards was the whole assembly process. I built my Zoom98 together with a friend because I didn’t trust myself to do it alone — I just didn’t have the confidence or that “builder’s touch.” That’s actually why I came quite late to the custom keyboard hobby. I started out with a used Zoom75, which I also got from that same friend who helped me with my first build.\n\nSo when I found out about the ND104, I was honestly thrilled — especially because it was available through Kickstarter and came pre-assembled. When you first hold the packaging, you immediately get that solid, premium feel. And that impression continues through the entire unboxing and setup: taking it out, plugging it in, and hitting those first keys.\n\nThe sound is satisfying but not too loud — perfect for office use. I’ve taken it with me to work for several days now; it’s definitely heavy in the backpack, but absolutely worth it. Typing simply feels great.\n\nI also love the color and the lighting effects — they look fantastic without being over the top. The little display that shows which keys you’re pressing is a fun and surprisingly useful touch. I didn’t expect to enjoy that feature so much, but I really do.\n\nConnectivity-wise, it’s excellent: I use USB-C for my gaming PC and Bluetooth for my work laptop, and switching between them works flawlessly.\n\nFor its price and build quality, the ND104 is an outstanding keyboard — especially if you’ve always been hesitant about building a custom one yourself. It comes ready out of the box but still delivers that luxurious, mechanical typing experience. A fantastic keyboard overall. Before owning a Zoom, I used to by the high end models from a company starting with L and ending with tech. They don’t come close to the ND104 (and the Zoom). That is why I think the price tag for the ND104 is so good. \n\nI also baked the iso version of the keyboard and I am very eager to update this post (or make a new one) after this version arrives in the future. \n",

So yeah, quite a few favorite bands and lyrics didn’t make it. At least not *on this one*. But since I love this kind of creative chaos, they’ll find a home somewhere else.\n\nOf course, these are the bands that influenced me. Some directly — The Prodigy, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor (their lyrics are crazy inspiring, and DesRay’s voice? Love it). Others show up more as little nods or references.\n\n**Dance Away → Roxette**  \nI’m still in love with Marie Fredriksson’s voice, and Per Gessle is one of those rare musicians who can fit more good ideas into one song than most do in an entire album.\n\n**Black No. 1 → Type O Negative**  \nPeter Steele — the man, the music, the attitude — pure layers of brilliance.\n\n**3DOM.L.F → Believe in Freedom, Love and Fortune**  \n(A DJ Bobo thing, by the way.) The “3” also brings in the *Zombieland* crew in spirit — Little Rock, Nevada, Wichita, and Columbus.\n\n**Let Me B 3 → 2 Brothers again**  \nHad to highlight that one. On one of the connectors, I also wrote *Keep Your Dreams Alive*, though it’s probably too tiny to see.\n\n**Alive →** from *Madden Alive*, but even more that moment in *Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency*.  \nIt’s pure freedom, soul, happiness — life. And yeah, Douglas Adams.  \nAlso, Drummer Girl, Dirk, Todd, the Twins… and hopefully Bart’s story turns out okay too.  \nReminder to self: imagination, fantasy — build my own *Wendimoore.*\n\n**Turn Up The Power → N-Trance**  \nMy favorite track of theirs. At first I just wrote “tuurnn” next to the volume knob, then this title came to mind, and I squeezed it in — just like we used to cram doodles into notebook margins.\n\n**Hurricane →** because of my old saying:  \n*Nothing happens with the hurricane — the hurricane happens.*  \nAlso a little nod to the *Chew Lips* and *Theory of a Deadman* tracks of the same name.\n\n**Good Vibrations →** had to be here anyway, but this one’s a bonus: Marky Mark & Loleatta Holloway.  \nThat song’s energy, Mark’s wild teenage years, his early work — all of it inspires me.  \nAnd while we’re at it…\n\n**P.I.J M.M → Prince Ital Joe & Marky Mark**  \nTheir *United* album. Massive favorite — the message, the feeling, the vibe.  \n*I wanna see more happy people!*\n\n**GBGTHBTBBGE → Good Boys Go to Heaven, But the Bad Boys Go Everywhere**  \nWhen it comes to soul-defining music, there has to be Meat Loaf and *Bat Out of Hell.*  \n(*Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come Through* would’ve been too many “dreams” — and this quote just fits.)\n\n**Fire → Scooter (HP Baxxter’s voice, of course)**  \nThe mosh pits at Tabacco (that old rough disco in Pécs), guitar jamming in the square, shouting, energy.  \nAnd obviously — the best element!\n\n**Out of Space → The Prodigy**  \nA small pun under “Space”, but also one of their defining songs for me.  \nI can almost hear Dune’s “I was sent to outer space,” and it sums up my love for rave.  \n(*Hardcore Feelings* / *Can’t Stop Raving* didn’t fit anymore 😅.)\n\n**Dreams Can Come True →** basically the slogan of the ’90s. I used to write it everywhere, and I meant it.  \nStill haven’t outgrown it — and honestly, “growing up” was never my strong suit 🙂.  \nIt also ties into *Let the Dream Come True* (DJ Bobo) and *Rock’n’Roll Dreams Come True.*\n\n**? →** My personal symbol, in memory of *Indian Larry.*  \nNot a musician, but one of the most inspiring people I’ve ever heard about.  \nI totally get his question mark.\n\n# Random Words & Reminders\n\nThings I used to scribble everywhere, now made their way here — sometimes with a twist:\n\n* **Free** — doesn’t need explaining, but I shouldn’t forget it either.\n* **NRG** — same energy.\n* **Music** — the explanation itself.\n* **Never Give Up** — cliché, sure, but sometimes I needed the reminder.\n* **X-plorer 4ever** — probably my most defining trait. I want to see, do, and experience everything.\n* **Unbordered** — took a while to find. Wanted something that says “I don’t fit in boxes,” kind of like *out of the box.* I tried *unboxable*, *borderless*, but this one felt right.\n* **Chaos is good** — because it is. And Kevin Flynn was right.\n* **DST** — as in *distortion.* Every guitarist knows. I just love dirty creativity.\n* **OWER** — one of my many names (yes, with a W on purpose). I use it less professionally now, too many puns (*overload*, *overclass*...). Still, I added a tiny “-drive,” because if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.\n\n# And of course, the coder side couldn’t stay out of it:\n\n* `404 limits not found`\n* `ALT + CTRL + Faith`\n* `coffee.exe`\n\nPlus a few classic notebook doodles:  \nPlanets and stars next to *Space*, a tic-tac-toe at the top (because every notebook had one), a smiley face, upward arrows, musical notes, rhythm pattern (BD-SD-BD-HH-BD), my own sign, Morse code, lines, random scratches… the works.\n\nThat’s about all that fit — for now.  \nI’ve still got room on the bottom of the shield, just need to figure out the lacquer — brush smears the paint, and I don’t want to spray near the electronics. Maybe next round.\n\nAnyway… I’ve already got enough ideas for another keyboard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsv3rkiaqgxf1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd99746018d8390e7c134e25d0fc7ac147f43fc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqqwn3ubqgxf1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49b3d7867687f02ebc3621b99c686cc5a0ffb3fe\n\n",

    "title": "Low Profile TKL Mechanical: Keychron K1 Max vs Razer Deathstalker vs Logitech G515 vs Logitech G915.",
    "selftext": "TLDR: Sharing some thoughts on 4 \"mainstream\" TKL low profile keyboards. I'm not a keyboard expert, so take this as a normal user's experience. Please feel free to skip the post.\n\nHey there!\n\nI thought I'd share my quick thoughts about the last few keyboards I used in case someone cares. Bit about me: I'm a software engineer. I type around 120 wpm. Used to be global elite in CSGO and played in local tournaments.\n\nComing from membrane gaming keyboards, I hated mechanical keyboards because of the very long key travel which made typing a chore. I also didn't like how loud they were (even with red switches, I had to add o rings to reduce the noise)\n\nI finally tried a low profile keyboard with the ***Logitech G915 TKL*** and it was a big upgrade. The main issue with this keyboard was the keys feeling cheap. Caps aren't stable. Typing feeling scratchy and not sounding nice at all. All in all it did the job but didn't feel premium at all.\n\n**Razer Deathstalker V2 TKL:**\n\nGreat keyboard, more premium than the G915 for sure. Out of the box the switches on the red version are way too sensitive, just resting your fingers would trigger it. I loved that I could swap the switches so I switched from razer's red to Gateron banana low profile optical. (tried Gateron brown and red too, bananas are my favorite because they don't sound loud while adding a very nice bump at the top which makes key presses intentional and precise)\n\nI would recommend it but there are much better keyboards now. If you're on a budget and can get it on sale then it's a good option to be honest, especially if you get the tactile version or plan to swap the switches. Don't get the reds unless you're sure you don't rest your fingers on keys.\n\n**Logitech G515:**\n\nRecently, I wanted to try something else after using the Deathstalker for about 2 years so I got the *G515* with brown switches.\n\nIt very well built and premium feeling but sadly I can't swap the switches on this one. The biggest problem I found is that the space bar is absolutely unusable due to needing a lot of force to be pressed. I couldn't find a solution for this issue so I'm going to return it for sure.\n\nNot recommended.\n\n**Keychron research:**\n\nI was looking around for a very long time for the next keyboard I should buy. In the end I settled on Keychron because I could buy the keyboard locally and get support in case anything happens. Also they're a well known enthusiast brand and recommended by many.\n\nI heard a lot about other companies but many of them don't offer TKL versions of their keyboards which is a deal breaker for me as I like my keyboard to match the layout of my laptop as much as possible (Macbook Pro 16)\n\nThe shopping experience and documentation on Keychron's their website is the worst I've ever seen. I recommend you just email them to get answers and let them recommend the best keyboard to buy (don't use chat, for some reason they just send old links). List your requirements and ask for the latest release they have that fits. Also ALWAYS opt for swappable key switches so it's easy to fix double clicking issues if they arise (prone to happen if you get mechanical switches instead of optical ones).\n\n**Keychron K1 Max:**\n\nIn the end I got the ***Keychron K1 Max*** with reds (wanted browns but wasn't available locally)\n\nIt's a very nice keyboard, very premium feeling and the keys are stable and sound very nice. Out of the box the bindings are bit strange but you can modify them very easily by using [launcher.keychron.com](http://launcher.keychron.com/) but upgrade your keyboards firmware BEFORE you rebind your keys because your rebinds will be reset. Also don't use [usevia.app](http://usevia.app/), it doesn't work for some reason even though it's mentioned in the manual.\n\nI like the layout of the keyboard and how small and easy to carry it is. Wish it had a spot to store the dongle.\n\nWill be trying some switches for sure. On keychron's website, I see that low profile silent, Milk POM (self-lubricating?), Gateron 2.0, and Keychron low profile are all compatible with this keyboard. I ordered Gateron low profile 2.0 chocolate and banana and will be testing those first. I saw that the Gateron 2.0 bananas have a bit more pre-travel compared with the keychron switches but the keyboard came with Gateron 2.0 reds so I'm more inclined to stick with those.\n\nAlso I'll be swapping the key caps to ones that shine through when they come in stock because the keycaps that come with the keyboard don't show the letters at night (they are completely solid). I read this is to not sacrifice the keycaps durability but I work in the dark sometimes and need to be able to read the keys.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Keychron so far and haven't faced any issues with it.\n\nHope this was helpful to someone and happy to answer any questions.",

    "title": "My FIRST and ONLY (maybe) mechanical keyboard ever, and it uses TOPRE switches (Realforce RC1)",
    "selftext": "I have absolutely NOTHING to compare this keyboard to since it's my first ever one I owned, I've only used laptop keyboards up until now lol (but I plan on having a proper desktop PC in the future). That being said, I have a fresh impression of Topre switches, which I have to say feels great! The notable bump before pressing down is super satisfying, and it is definitely quieter than a lot of keyboards I've heard and used at work, which is a priority for me. That being said, the spacebar is notably loud compared to the rest of the keys, very pronounced 'thock' as you could say. Maybe there's a way for me to silence it, so I'm open to any suggestions on that! Not pictured here, but I also got a keyboard mat which does make a difference in dampening the sound a little bit as well as the vibrations!\n\nI love that this keyboard has a function row, and also some nice functions keys mapped on the regular keys, although it might take some getting used to taking screenshots for example. Also the much smaller right shift key too, I never thought I'd miss a normal sized right shift key even though I rarely use it... but the layout feels similar to laptop keyboards, so it didn't take too long for me to adjust aside from the obvious travel time difference. I'm making typos like crazy, but that's just the part of getting used to a new keyboard I guess lol\n\nI coughed up $235 for the Realforce RC1 [https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/topre-realforce-rc1-75-bluetooth-keyboard), so would I say it's worth the price? For me, it was based on comfort. Like I said before, it didn't take me long to adjust to the keyboard size since it's similar to a laptop keyboard size without the numpad. Having worked in an office that has keyboards using numpads, I realized the ergonomic issue when typing of trying to either center align it causing the numpad to take up mouse space or aligning it in a way that the numpad no longer takes up that space, but I'll have to reach further left with my right hand to type, which is rather uncomfortable long-term. Honestly, if you don't have this kind of issue that I do, you can spend SIGNIFICANTLY less and get a Realforce R3S TKL or with a numpad, I just personally like the alignment and how compact the RC1 is in comparison, since I plan on taking it around with me too. I also have an external numpad if I need to use one.\n\nI also wanted a keyboard that works perfect as is out of the box, which Realforce absolutely delivers on. I've had a Realforce mouse for much longer than I have with this keyboard here, and I've waited excitedly to finally get my hands on a Realforce keyboard to complete my peripherals. It's quite pricey, but I shudder to think how much more I would be spending if I got into buying keycaps and swapping switches all the time.\n\nIt's also pretty light! And the ability to switch between wired and Bluetooth mode is nice, but I do have a concern with it using a lithium-ion battery, which is why I titled the post \"maybe\". I imagine a keyboard like this could last a really long time, but it's hard to tell with a rechargeable battery, although it does say that it can last up to a month on a full charge. If I do ever get another keyboard in the future, it'll likely be an HHKB which uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable one, unless Realforce continues to develop on this model with HHKB's approach. But an HHKB sacrifices function row keys and also switches different keys around like the caps lock and shift key, which I am not quite ready for at the moment haha.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this keyboard a lot! I'm sure anything else that isn't Topre will not feel the same way anymore as a lot of other people have also said. Truly a one-of-a-kind experience. I'll try to answer any questions to the best of my ability!",

I had to do a lot of stuff for university including coding and all of that. I'm currently using a MacBook Air (15\"). I bought the 15 inch because I heard it's better if you have a larger screen it's not as bad for your eyes compared to a smaller 13\" screen. But I somehow feel like it's still bad for my eyes.\n\nAs far as I know, my laptop has a LCD screen. Would an OLED be better? I also use a lamp behind my laptop because I've heard (and read) that also helps against eye strain. If I got something like a 28 or 30 inch OLED screen, would that be a lot better? If that is the case, can someone recommend me a good external display that I can connect via USB C?\n\nI don't know if it's the stress (bc of exams and all the studying) or working on my laptop for 4-6 hours daily. But it's driving me nuts.",

    "selftext": "Heyo everybody. I hope y'all are well.\n\nI don't really have a lot of knowledge regarding monitors, but I would like to start to look for a new one.\n\nRight now I have the Odyssey G6 (since almost 2 years) for my PS5 Pro.\nIt is not bad but I got it because of the integrated OS and a good sale at that time. It definitely has some flaws.\n\nNow I really want to focus more on the performance, so I guess 4k, HDMI 2.1 and 120 hz should be a must have. The question now is should I go with a normal IPS, a Mini LED or OLED. First problem is, OLED is too expensive.\n\nI looked a little bit into RTINGS and when I compared their ratings for OLED and Mini LED, the OLED monitors had *much* higher ratings which surprised me, because I always see good feedback to Mini LEDs here in this subreddit.\nThen again OLED is too expensive. The only affordable monitor they recommended is the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27ACDNG for 689€. It got also a really nice review but it is not 4k, unfortunately.\n\nBecause of the price I was tending more to Mini LED, but after seeing the ratings on RTINGS and that big difference in comparison to OLED I am really not sure anymore.\n\nIs there anything I need to know? Anything specific I should look at?\n\nYour help will be much appreciated 🥲",

I understand certain monitors offer KVM functionality, but given my setup, would it be possible to switch between Desktop and Laptop while getting all 3 of Video, Mouse And Keys at once? Given that the mouse and keyboard each are connected to a bluetooth receiver (USB-A). My understanding is, I would need to plug those receivers into the monitor, along with 2 other cables for Desktop/Laptop (DIsplayPort/HDMI).\n\n\n\nWould this even work, and is there any monitor with this many ports? One of my USB-C ports on the laptop is also taken up, which would mean that the one that connects from the monitor would have to charge/maintain the battery as well. ",

The paint was already chipping in several places, some bolts had damaged threads, it was nearly impossible to adjust the monitor even after trying all the settings from minimum to maximum, and the parts felt cheap, like the plastic cable management piece. When I tried adjusting the monitor, it actually bent the pivot joint. I was honestly shocked by the quality.\n\nOne of the arms even broke before I could mount a monitor on it. At $107, this is just embarrassing. What really gets me is that Ergotron sells the same arm for around $180. These should cost $20 at most. I have no idea how they get good reviews. Maybe they're fake?\n\nAnyway, moving on from that, I'd love to get some recommendations from you guys.\n\nI'm thinking of maybe getting a Desky Dual Spring Eco Monitor Arm or the HUANUO gas spring dual monitor mount.\n\nI'm building a standing desk setup for a new work from home job.

    "selftext": "If you want to run 4K on a 2K monitor like the **LG 27GX700A-B**, but the game limits your monitor’s refresh rate at 4K, here’s how to fix it:\n\n# Steps:\n\n1. **Turn off DSR in NVIDIA Control Panel** first.\n2. Open **CRU (Custom Resolution Utility)**.\n3. Go to **CTA-861 → 1 Detailed Resolution → 7 Data Blocks**.\n4. **Delete the TV resolutions** from the list.\n5. Run **restart64.exe** (included in CRU) to restart the graphics driver.\n6. Open **NVIDIA Control Panel** again.\n7. Enable **DSR** at 4K for your games.\n\n>\n\n# Why this works:\n\n* The resolutions that come with the monitor (the “TV resolutions” in CRU) **interfere with NVIDIA DSR**.\n* If they remain, the GPU cannot fully render 4K internally, and it **limits refresh rates** (Hz) or causes zoom/scaling issues in games.\n* Deleting these entries removes conflicts, allowing DSR to work properly.\n* Restarting the driver applies the changes.\n* Now your GPU can render **4K internally** and downscale it to 2K correctly, giving you sharp images and correct refresh rates.\n\n# Tips:\n\n* Always back up your CRU profile before making changes.\n* Test games individually; some need desktop at 4K, others just handle it internally.\n* Works for monitors like **LG 27GX700A-B** and should also work for other 2K panels supporting DSR.\n* Using **Fullscreen Exclusive mode** in games usually ensures correct refresh rates and proper downscaling.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been rocking an Acer Predator Z35P for the past 8 years and I'm finally looking to upgrade to an HDR-enabled monitor. After extensive research, I've narrowed it down to the TCL 34R83Q for both programming and gaming (I'm avoiding OLED due to burn-in concerns).\n\nThat monitor launched around April 2024, so it's been out for 18 months, yet I cannot find any proper long-term reviews. TCL is also relatively unknown in monitors, which bothers me since I'm planning to keep this for 6+ years.\n\nSo I've got a few questions for actual owners:\n\n* Any issues after 6+ months of daily use? If so, have there been firmware updates from TCL to fix these?\n* I've read about flickering/blinkink/VRR troubles... is this Nvidia-specific or also AMD? I'll also be buying a new GPU, currently hesitating between 9070 XT or 5070 Ti.\n* G-Sync-compatibility: is this user-proof? I read about unreliability in one review, perhaps just an isolated case...\n* Are there any issues with blooming/uniformity or dead pixel after 1y+ usage?\n\nIt's currently at 699 EUR on amazon, which seems like good value, but only if it actually lasts. Any real-world experiences would be helpful.\n\nThanks!",

Color saturation was a bit weird (especially for an OLED) no matter how much I tweak with the settings, but otherwise it served me well.\n\nAround August, 9 months after purchase, I noticed some weird glitching at the bottom of the panel. I thought it might be a problem with my PC, thought after days of troubleshooting, I realized the problem was with the monitor since using a different cable with a my old laptop still didn't solve the issue. I contacted AOC about this since then thought various methods, from their official website to their email but with no response, and the issue is only getting worse, because on late August black horizontal bars are all over the monitor and on September 16 the monitor started to black screens every 15 seconds or so for around 4 seconds.\n\nThe warranty I got is 4 years of no dead pixels, 4 years of advanced replacement and a year of free replacement for accidental damage, and with my luck so far I'm sure their gonna find something to get them to have it go under user-damage, and I only got 4 weeks until that expires.\n\n\nWhat hurts is that I spent a lot to ship this monitor to my region and that I sacrificed some of the GPU budget to squeeze in that OLED panel so I guess the moral of the story is don't ship monitors overseas and prioritize performance over display for gaming if you can't stretch your budget\n\n",

This is my first IPS monitor so I'm not sure how I feel about the constant noticeable backlighting I can see. (couple screenshots to show what it looks like on camera, which looks way worse in camera than with my human eyes)\n\nI'm doing my best to research and learn about monitors and their features, but admittedly I am still very ignorant.\n\nI came from a Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 and I think the biggest thing I didn't like about that was the ghosting around test and the cursor (which I believe is probably from the fact it was a VA panel?)\n\nI'm not noticing that ghosting issue at all with this MSI IPS monitor, but I'm curious if maybe something like that Innocn GA27T1M being a mini-LED IPS would maybe be that sweet spot?\n\nAlso before I bought the MSI, I tried the new [ASUS XG27UCDMG](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-rog-strix-27-4k-oled-240hz-0-03ms-gaming-monitor-with-freesync-premium-pro-and-hdr-displayport-hdmi-black/JJGGLQ5XSP) and I think I've ultimately decided that OLED is not for me. They're just too dark for my enjoyment.\n\nIf anyone has any advice or recommendations on a 27\" or 32\" 2K or 4K non-OLED monitor, I'd be happy to hear :)\n\nThank you everyone for your time and your advice, and have a great day!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4zkk5almexf1.jpg?width=2104&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70872b4582234ddc7679524a3171700fac0bdeec\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yobs5almexf1.jpg?width=1404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db59b9e83443a78b0914d0fce1e13bfd086a8924",

    "selftext": "More of a discussion thread. I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\nSince pixel shift draws a slightly smaller image within my panel and then shifts that around (which, by the way I notice. EVERY time it does it.) this means that either the panel isnt 1440p but bigger, or the displayed image is smaller than 1440p.\n\nI paid for a monitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and I would like to think that I get to use all of those pixles at the same time without having to \"bunch\" my image by even a fraction of a percent and have 2 rows of pixels merging/overriding each other.\n\nIt doesn't sit well with me to know I'm at no point ever using the entire panel at once which has the specified resolution. I surely cannot be alone with that. I'd like to turn pixel shift off.\n\nIs there a firmware version out there that lets me turn it off? Is my assumption about the panel wrong? Do you have thoughts or opinions to share about burn-in risks without pixel shift? Please let me know.\n\n  \nEdit: Downvoted to zero for a simple question with zero fluff or bullshit. Now nobody that might have valuable input can see this post. Thanks guys",

At some point it all got a little much, cause you have like \"IPS\" and \"VA\" and \"Mini-LED\" and IPS displays can also be Mini-LED at the same time? Just need some suggestions that fall within my requirements and needs.\n\nBudget is around 3000NOK give or take (roughly 300USD) per display, though I'm not looking to get more than two.\n\nHas to be 16:9.\n\nHas to have VESA 100x100mm or 75x75mm mounts.  \nHas to weigh 13kg or less. \n\nPrefer the display to have a physical size of 25 inches, I don't know if could comfortably fit two 27 inch displays next to each other with the space I have, even with monitor arms. And I'd rather have two displays of the same size and not mismatched sizes to work around space constraints.\n\nPrefer 1440p at most, anything above that is overkill IMO.\n\nNot too fuzzy about refresh rate, my current AOC G2590FXs have been capped to 60Hz for the past 7 years despite being 144Hz. If I increased the refresh rate beyond 60 all the colors would become sharper, which isn't inherently bad, but in some games the colors would become so dark it was almost unplayable, and I wasn't able to find any setting on the monitor itself to change the color mode. Not saying I expect this to be the case with all monitors, just saying this was my experience with my first high refresh rate monitor which is why I'm currently not fuzzy about high refresh rates. ",

    "selftext": "Hey ya’ll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I’m currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol. \n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that’s nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

    "selftext": "First time in the market after 16 years. Replacing an Asus VS228 that was a hand-me-down.  But I'm overwhelmed in reading the reviews here, and Amazon and rtigns. I'll find a monitor I can afford, is available, and rtigns likes it, but reddit hates it. TN vs VS vs IPA. How many dimming zones is enough, apparently QA can pass a monitor with 5 dead pixels, does that matter or not? So many pop up Chinese manufacturers I don't recognize, what's good what's bad. And in all of it there doesn't seem to be a consensus on what's good. mini led vs oled vs qled vs qned.\n\nWhat response time is enough, how to read refresh rates spec, a monitor advertises 180hz....at its lowest resolution. At the highest resolution it's 60. So do I want resolution, refresh. Or both? Why is refresh non standard increments, 60, 75, 144, 180? I don't see the trend there. 1080, 2160, ratios and expanding binary base 2 at least makes some sense. \n\nPart of the problem is probably I'm ignoring the $600+ category. \nFor all my ranting I'm looking at.\n\nMSI MAG 27CQ6F\n\nMSI G274QPF\n\nAOC Q27G3XMN\n\nThank you for listening",

    "selftext": "Hey ya’ll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I’m currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol. \n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that’s nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

Beautiful constrast and sharper compare to my old one (Galax Vivance 01). \n\nBut 15 minutes later I got eye strain and headache. I thought it just normal to adapt high contrast screen, but it got worse for a whole day.\n\nLater I try to switch to FHD 320hz mode and turn off local-dimming, and it's completely fine for 2 hours of CS2. \n\nI tried to test a lot of things. Games, Movies, Web browsing. Many problems occurred with this one but the eyestrain and headache with local dimming is still the worst thing. I bought this one specially for Miniled to have near black so now I think I have to return it.\n\nMay I ask does Mini-LED can cause things like that? I love to have near black, but due to this I scared to try any Mini-LED monitor.",

I had to do a lot of stuff for university including coding and all of that. I'm currently using a MacBook Air (15\"). I bought the 15 inch because I heard it's better if you have a larger screen it's not as bad for your eyes compared to a smaller 13\" screen. But I somehow feel like it's still bad for my eyes.\n\nAs far as I know, my laptop has a LCD screen. Would an OLED be better? I also use a lamp behind my laptop because I've heard (and read) that also helps against eye strain. If I got something like a 28 or 30 inch OLED screen, would that be a lot better? If that is the case, can someone recommend me a good external display that I can connect via USB C?\n\nI don't know if it's the stress (bc of exams and all the studying) or working on my laptop for 4-6 hours daily.

I hope y'all are well.\n\nI don't really have a lot of knowledge regarding monitors, but I would like to start to look for a new one.\n\nRight now I have the Odyssey G6 (since almost 2 years) for my PS5 Pro.\nIt is not bad but I got it because of the integrated OS and a good sale at that time. It definitely has some flaws.\n\nNow I really want to focus more on the performance, so I guess 4k, HDMI 2.1 and 120 hz should be a must have. The question now is should I go with a normal IPS, a Mini LED or OLED. First problem is, OLED is too expensive.\n\nI looked a little bit into RTINGS and when I compared their ratings for OLED and Mini LED, the OLED monitors had *much* higher ratings which surprised me, because I always see good feedback to Mini LEDs here in this subreddit.\nThen again OLED is too expensive. The only affordable monitor they recommended is the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27ACDNG for 689€. It got also a really nice review but it is not 4k, unfortunately.\n\nBecause of the price I was tending more to Mini LED, but after seeing the ratings on RTINGS and that big difference in comparison to OLED I am really not sure anymore.\n\nIs there anything I need to know? Anything specific I should look at?\n\nYour help will be much appreciated 🥲",

Don't care about text being a bit worse just want whatever will look best in games and movies. \n70 games 30% media\n\nWould u get oled or ips?\n",

And this monitor has waaaay too many settings for me, a non-initiated.  So far, the best I have been able to do is set it up to sRGB and tweak the brightness a little, but I'm still defaulting to my old one for the better color accuracy. \n\nDoes anyone already have a settings profile they are cool sharing? \n\nIf anybody wants to help, I don't mind taking pictures/video/tests with my phone (S22Ultra) in the best quality I can. \n\n  \nAny help appreciated!",

I did some digging using Copilot but there seem to be some inconsistencies so I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this.\n\n  \nI have a desktop PC (Linux) and a laptop (Windows) which I would like to be able to switch between relatively seamlessly. Currently, I have the MX Master 3 Logitech Keys + Mouse for switching between the two, but this is also relatively uncomfortable - both need to be switched independently + I have to twist my head and hunch over the small laptop screen to work. I understand certain monitors offer KVM functionality, but given my setup, would it be possible to switch between Desktop and Laptop while getting all 3 of Video, Mouse And Keys at once? Given that the mouse and keyboard each are connected to a bluetooth receiver (USB-A). My understanding is, I would need to plug those receivers into the monitor, along with 2 other cables for Desktop/Laptop (DIsplayPort/HDMI).\n\n\n\nWould this even work, and is there any monitor with this many ports? One of my USB-C ports on the laptop is also taken up, which would mean that the one that connects from the monitor would have to charge/maintain the battery as well. ",

    "selftext": "I decided to try two Amazon Basics (Ergotron) monitor arms, but I returned them after just 12 hours. They were really disappointing. The paint was already chipping in several places, some bolts had damaged threads, it was nearly impossible to adjust the monitor even after trying all the settings from minimum to maximum, and the parts felt cheap, like the plastic cable management piece. When I tried adjusting the monitor, it actually bent the pivot joint. I was honestly shocked by the quality.\n\nOne of the arms even broke before I could mount a monitor on it. At $107, this is just embarrassing. What really gets me is that Ergotron sells the same arm for around $180. These should cost $20 at most. I have no idea how they get good reviews. Maybe they're fake?\n\nAnyway, moving on from that, I'd love to get some recommendations from you guys.\n\nI'm thinking of maybe getting a Desky Dual Spring Eco Monitor Arm or the HUANUO gas spring dual monitor mount.\n\nI'm building a standing desk setup for a new work from home job. I'll be using 2 27\" or 32\" monitors (still waiting for sales). I want to get the monitors at a comfortable height.",

    "title": "MSI MPG 274URDFW E16M vs KTC M27P6 Comparison:",
    "selftext": "Hey ya’ll, I finally got around to making this review/comparison. I’m currently running side by side mounted on their stands. Please note I have no professional equipment and this is all just side by side comparison. I did come from a nice IPS display that was an omen 27qs and I have an LG CX oled TV for comparison. Used my iphone 16 PM as well lol. \n\n[Proof!](https://preview.redd.it/jqjmjoq0ndxf1.jpg?width=8064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b3b88da3874fcf3f64fdc764c7546dbe17adb33)\n\n**GPU: RX 9070xt**  \n**OS:** Linux (CachyOS) and Windows 11 Pro 24H2.  \n**Connection:** OEM Included DP cables.  \n**Games Tested**: Stalker 2, Arc Raiders Playtest, The finals, BF6, Factorio, Halo Infinite, Returnal.\n\n# Quality:\n\n* **Stand:** The MSI stand is interesting because it feels expensive yet cheap. I think the metal base and looks make it seem high quality but the plastics feel a little cheap and the height adjustment is a little disappointing. It goes about half an inch lower than the KTC and monitors unboxed mentioned this. The MSI's rotating and pivoting feels good. No issues there. Definitely feels higher quality than KTC. The KTC feels a little flimsier and has less friction overall which doesn’t feel as luxurious, but it gets the job done. KTC is all plastic, no metal base.\n* **Joystick:** The MSI is on another level here. The texture on the button is nice and it’s firm and tactile. Definitely feels like when you first use the Xbox Elite series controller. Everything feels tight. It’s also lit, so that’s kinda nice. The KTC is again flimsy and honestly feels like it’s been used for years. It literally has stick drift brand new and it’s also in the back instead of the bottom so it’s harder to reach. \n\n# Monitor Build/looks:\n\nAgain the MSI wins hands down Looks better from the back, the chin doesn’t bother me. Creaking and build quality seems similar.\n\n# Accessories:\n\nThe MSI has white cables which is nice. I don’t really care but if you do it’s a nice add on. Although the MSI cables feel a little short. KTC are black and again fine. Both have the usb type b as the KVM but the msi has a slightly different shaped plug. Not sure what’s up with that. Ports are fine. \n\n# Software:\n\nMSI wins in some areas and KTC in others. As I said before, it has better customization. It has more crosshairs and the crosshair changes color. You can also update the firmware so there is optimism if anything needs to be fixed and in my experience something does seriously need to get fixed. But I’ll get to that later. You can customize which quick setting is set for each of the four directions. And dual mode is accessible with 2 button clicks. The MSI also has a desktop app so you can configure it there. Pretty nice.  The ktc is non customizable and dual mode has to be dug in the settings. BUT, you can actually control gamma, hue, and saturation on it. In case you need to make adjustments with that. It also has more HDR modes. I kept it on the Vesa one the whole time. Keep in mind the KTC likely will not have hardware updates. On their website it says firmware is final, so that’s a little concerning. \n\n# Dual Monitor:\n\nWould not recommend the 1080 mode on either. It’s so blurry imo. I have 3 1080p 27 inch monitors for work and they are much clearer. I had to play some games with AA off to make it more bearable. Or maybe TAA and Non Integer scaling don’t work for me. Too fuzzy and made my eyes strain and my head hurt. You might be ok. \n\n# Now the Good Stuff!\n\n# Response:\n\nIn SDR the input lag is imperceptible to me on both displays. And it seems in professional testing that it’s around 5 ms without Local Dimming so it’s not really an issue. Felt snappy and didn’t notice any issues at 4k 60hz or 4k 120HZ+.\n\nIn HDR, it was a little difficult. I feel like it was just barely close enough to not feel it. What I mean is, you get used to it so fast since it’s so small, if you can feel it. This is unlike frame gen which adds significant input lag and I can feel it every time. So, HDR or Local Dimming in SDR had no issues with input lag on both monitors. It felt fine to me running at mostly 120fps+ on the competitive games I played (The Finals, Arc Raiders Playtest, BF6). YMMV.\n\n# Brightness:\n\nIn SDR, the ktc gets significantly brighter. It easily outshines the MSI. The MSI by comparison looks a little bit dull. I find that confusing as it’s the same panel and it’s SDR, neither is hitting 1000+ nits. The MSI felt around 400 nits, the KTC felt maybe close to double which is crazy. They both get low enough to not have any issues in the dark. \n\nIn HDR, I had weird issues. When running 2 monitors at HDR on windows, it seemed to prefer the MSI all the time. It worked well with auto HDR, and was brighter than the KTC consistently. Which made no sense as the KTC 100 percent is brighter on other platforms. Could be because I have an amd card or could just be KTC and windows. I tried HDMI, DP, different cables, different ports, and updated to 25H2 to see if it was fixed. YMMV. \n\nIn Linux and on my Chromecast, the KTC gets what seems 30-50% brighter than the MSI consistently. The MSI is good, but the KTC actually blows you away a bit and easily destroys my LG CX. \n\nReally only used Linux to A/B test with Windows for some of the issues I had. Didn’t play games since Linux HDR support is iffy. \n\n# HDR Color:\n\nThis is the point where hopefully I don’t get called a hypocrite. If you look at my comment history I recommended the E16M consistently once I got it. But I was mistaken. At first when I received the MSI, I thought the KTC looked washed out and overbrightened. But really the MSI is saturated, unnaturally so.  Even when trying to dull everything down with HDR calibration and the ODS settings. The greens on the MSI look too green. The trees, grass, and plants are too vibrant. The reds are too red.  Dirt, house colors, the sun, even the color of an owl looks to yellowy/orange. Watching this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0LjN5U4hg&t=397s), the sunsets look too deeply red. Not at all like real life. The houses at 13:43 don’t look a pale, sun beaten orange. It seems like somebody dropped a bit of highlighter red on them and they pop too much. At 5:31 the yellow line on the road looks too orangey-yellowish. I know what those lines look like in real life and they don’t look red shifted. Feels like I’m looking at a Samsung AMOLED from like 10 years ago with the vivid setting set to max. I tried everything, updated the firmware, calibrated, changed cables, changed OS’s, installed the msi driver, used the icc profile from msi, tried the desktop software to try and force the movie preset for more accuracy. I even changed the saturation and color on amd’s adrenalin. Nothing fixed it. It happens in both linux, windows, and my Chromecast so I know it’s the panel/firmware/calibration. It’s very unfortunate because once you catch it in a video or movie. It really irks you that the colors are unrealistic.\n\nFunnily it helps BF6 not look washed out, but it's not good for more regular naturally lit content.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the KTC destroys the MSI in colors, especially in HDR. Compared to my OLED TV and OLED iphone 16PM, the KTC is basically the same. The colors are accurate and realistic in HDR. And the brightness is freaking awesome. The problem is the KTC is not detected by auto HDR usually, and is very wonky with Windows. So it's hard to test video games that don't have native HDR. The MSI was consistently using auto HDR which was awesome for me since I don’t have an Nvidia gpu. \n\nAlso, at really bright, white scenes, the MSI loses detail. On a scene with a white cat laying down on top of a white blanket, the MSI is just overblown white on the blanket, while KTC preserves detail and you can see the individual blanket strings and the reflections at the tips. \n\n# SDR colors:\n\nIn SDR the panels are very close, although the MSI is slightly saturated still. But it would be passable. It seems they are suitable for professional work due to the clamping down. The sRGB modes looked identical to me. \n\nNote: Don’t touch the “premium color” gaming option on the MSI at HDR. All the saturation gets even worse and looks horribly overcolored. in SDR, it's ok. Makes everything pop a lot.\n\n# HDR Contrast/Blooming:\n\nBlooming is handled better by the MSI. It’s not a stomping, but the MSI gets a bit darker and has a bit less blooming. This is probably related to the brightness with the KTC being brighter. Although blooming is still well controlled, just not as excellently as the MSI. It's actually difficult to notice blooming on the MSI sometimes. It’s there but you have to pay attention to it. Once you play or watch a video you’ll never notice it again unless it's the youtube video menu's at the edge. I think since those are at the edge and because they cover so much they can be more noticeable. The KTC is close but you can see it a little easier. TBH, neither broke immersion or caused any issues. It’s just whether you want better contrast and less eye searing light scenes or slightly worse contrast but blinding bright snow scenes. Both do well. Although I have to say, the MSI only does this well on the highest LD setting, the other two settings still have that IPS glow. The KTC has 3 levels and all show what you expect of Mini-LED just at different aggressiveness with the brightness suffering at the highest level.\n\nNote: You can use LD in SDR content but you have to be comfortable with haloing and artifacting around text. Especially on grey backgrounds like youtube, steam, etc.. \n\n# Productivity:\n\nBoth are awesome for this. IPS at 4k 27 inch. Text is perfect and no eyestrain. Whites on the KTC are actually white though. The MSI are grayish white it seems again. I think my panel is borked. Or could be brightness issues again, but the MSI does not look white. Even after calibration and on full brightness\n\n# Issues: \n\n**MSI:** Actually I would’ve kept the MSI if color reproduction was good and whites we’re… white. It worked every time with windows and auto HDR actually worked consistently. Never had issues with games or playing anything. The software is nice too along with the desktop app. It’s really just the color inaccuracy which is unacceptable. I think something was definitely wrong with it but not enough to not be sent out. Annoying. \n\n**KTC:** It didn’t play that well with windows. HDR colors looked washed out on the desktop and auto HDR only turned on in a couple of games as opposed to MSI. If it was consistent, this is a killer panel and awesome monitor. The colors and brightness are exactly what you expect out of this type of tech. I’m kinda sad I couldn’t keep this one tbh…..\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAt the end of the day. Neither of the monitors worked out for me for different issues. The KSI has the better panel (or calibration), the MSI the better software. I think I’ll be returning them both and going back to my dual 1440p fast IPS monitors. I can’t justify spending half a rack for something that doesn’t work right and waiting for hopefully some update that fixes it. I’ll wait to see if things are ironed out and maybe try again at a later date. OLED is a no go for me since I do development work and supposed eye strain. I hope this helps and if you buy either, I hope you have no issues. \n\nLet me know if you want to know anything else. I’ll be returning them within the next week so I can answer any questions while they are on my desk. AND if you have any suggestions for solutions. I’m open to it!\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\nEdit: you can actually customize the joystick quick settings on the KTC. So that’s nice. You can set the dual mode to either the left, right, or down. ",

HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be £3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring. At that moment I realised that they are perfect for me.",

    "title": "Quick comparison of Arya Stealth vs Edition XS for metal music",
    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it’s tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For “heavier” music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that’s clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It’s an excellent headphone and if you don’t AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n·        FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n·        FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n·        FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n·        FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n·        FiiO KA11.\n\n·        FiiO JA11.\n\n·        MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n·        Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n·        Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n·        Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n·        Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**€13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 €/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of €30 than one of €100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but…\n\n…let's start with the **package content:**\n\n·        The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n·        User manual\n\n·        A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n·        A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n·        The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the €13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n·        A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n·        Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n·        Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n·        Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but… the highs got easily out of control…\n\n… I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is… somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child’s voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors’ behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies’ guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **€13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have me a pair of ATH-M50Xs that I replaced the ear cups on last year. I got the Wicked Cushions PadZ, and now I've been looking into EQ'ing them based on the Harman Curve. I see AutoEQ filters for the Dekoni ones, are they similar sounding to the Wickeds? Has anyone tested the frequency response with the Wicked pads? If there's not a preset for the WC's I guess I'll have to just get the Dekoni ones. Just not trying to replace perfectly good pads. I definitely think they're a little boomy without an EQ so any help would be appreciated.",

    "selftext": "Hope I got the right flair. Been Lurking here sometime. I’m About to make a job change to wfh and decided last week I’d get myself a Christmas present of noise cancellation, over the ear headphone to reduce those outside distractions while I’m trying to concentrate and focus. \n\n4 or 7 years or so ago the wife and I were goofing in a mall and visiting a crowded Apple Store for some reason. We live in a rural area and it’s two hours to the nearest so it’s a novel event and we wandered around checking out everything . Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I’ve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent. Best of all, my wife’s voice, right in front of my face trying to talk to me. Reminded me of that scene in, I think, Face Off with travolta and cage where someone drops headphones of soothing music on the little 4 yr old kid and then a huge gun battle breaks out. In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife’s lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days? How would I go about trying other models out? \n\nAlso appreciate advice on replacing ear pads, battery life, overall longevity of devices. ",

Yeah the highs are crisp, and I'll admit footsteps sound good, but I'm not getting the same emersive factor that I was getting from the nova pros. For example jumping out the plane in warzone the wind and engine sounded like it was actually up in your face if that makes sense, but with the Maxwells it just sounds thinned out. I have Atmos and the latest firmware installed and yes I tweaked with the EQ. Is there something I'm missing here?",

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick. But for $1000 you don't even get a charger, like how is a dude gonna charge the damn phone???",

    "selftext": "I've had my Bose QC headphones for about a month now and I'm gonna be honest. I love them. I think they sound incredibly clear, they fit me perfectly, and have unbelievable ANC. The bass isnt muddied or undefined, its very rumbley, both male a female vocals are amazing, and treble isnt too overshadowed by the bass rumble. To be fair, this is the most expensive set of headphones I have ever had, but the ones I've tested in stores (sony WH-1000XM5, beats studio pro, sony WH-1000XM4, Anker space one, apple airpods max) are \\*OVERALL\\* worse for me. the sound isnt as good as some other headphones, but these headphones are so comfortable and the ANC is so powerful I dont really mind the audio quality loss. What do you guys think? ",

Love the flat bass response down to like 20hz, no roll off. I think the treble is perfect for me and I don’t think vocals are too far back in the mix at all.\n\nI’ve had Sundara and Ananda in the past, as well as LCD 2C.\n\nWhile I never thought the Hifimans were overly piercing or too treble forward, I think the XV is definitely closer to the 2C in terms of overall tonality.\n\nWill definitely be keeping these.\n\nAre they better than 6xx? Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

I have seen some really nice stands on vids by Resolve (a Focal stand) and GadgetryTech (forget the brand), but those are $250-$500, more than I want to pay for a stand. I found these HiFi For All stands (pictured) which are affordable, and solve the problem, but I would prefer one with a bit of a longer headband area (vs just wide depth-wise). Like the ones on Gadgetry’s vids - there is one that has a little knob that looks like it is for length adjustment that looks nice too, but I can’t find it on the net. (Third picture, from his Aune AR5000 review, sorry for blurriness).\n\nI am thinking there must be some hidden gems out there that are reasonable affordable, and available in the US sans tariff/import fees, preferably.",

I never had a issue with the XS comfort either, but the Arya's feel so far more comfortable.\n\nThe sound is such an upgrade. Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them. I'll be listening to the Aryas and Fiio FT1 from now on, so they don't have any use. \n\nIn conclusion, these are brilliant and very happy I finally pulled the trigger. Well couldn't help it for £585 open box directly from Hifiman and comes with standard warranty 👌🏿. ",

I’m even willing to pay someone if they can help me get a working EQ preset for competitive play. 🙏\n\nIf anyone has a tried-and-tested Warzone EQ for the DT 770 PRO X (48 ohm) specifically — or knows what frequencies need to be reduced/boosted for footstep clarity on this model — I would be extremely grateful.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

The pads start to hurt my bottom left ear which has never happened before with stock pads or the stpad deluxe I have. Both my ears turned quite red. Maybe it’s different for you.\n\nEdit 2: I repositioned the headphone a bit backwards. Seems to help with the ear pain. But I don’t have confidence to say the pads will provide longer session comfort.\n\nEdit 3: If you like the stock tuning. Get the stpad deluxe. Similar tuning but better clarity, quality and a bit more sound stage. Better comfort too. \n\nUnfortunately, same as the stock pads, stpad2 don't really improve the passive sound isolation.\n\nThe pads noticeably change the sound for the better. You can feel the wider sound stage or I should say the distance the pads created the second you put them on.\n\nLess bass but just right, stock bass was too much for me. Sub bass doesn’t seem to be impacted much.\n\nBetter mids IMO. more separation, details.\n\nTreble is definitely more, airy but not really harsh to me so far.\n\nFeels like the tuning is now neutral bright like IEMs but still has good amount of bass. Japanese cheaper version of DT 700 I would say. ",

I would expect more at this price. honestly feels a bit plasticky and cheap. style also is very bland. doesn't look premium. Also, I personally don't like the swipe touch controls and I found them finicky.\n\nPX7 S3 - excellent. no leather. great styling and premium look. I enjoy the button controls better than the Sennheiser.\n\nPx8 S2 - excellent. has leather if you're concern about that. great styling and premium look even more than the px7. same button controls as the px7.\n\n**ANC:**\n\nHDB 630 - good but not great. with airplane noise it's about the same as the Px7. 630's were better with distinct noises like voices or background noise in a cafe or on a bus.\n\nPX7 S3 - good. not great. pretty good with airplane noise but distinct noises leak through quite a bit.\n\nPx8 S2 - just okay. worst of the bunch surprisingly. let in more airplane noise than the other two and distinct sounds leaked through quite a bit like the Px7\n\n**SQ:**\n\n**HDB 630:**\n\ntuning: pretty neutral\n\nspace and technicalities: space and staging is good. not great but all three are closed back so that's a natural limitation. Sennheiser is more relaxed and less \"fun\" but some audiophiles prefer that. both the Px7 and Px8 everything sounds closer and more \"fun\". good technicalities though. everything feels snappy and controlled. instrument separation is great.\n\nbass: well extended into sub bass and well controlled but is definitely not the star of the show. a bit thin sounding if you're not used to audiophile tuning. they can rumble though if you boost the bass with the EQ\n\nmids: maybe it's the audiophile tuning but it sounds a bit shouty to me. definitely not warm. lower mids seems thin while upper mids sound too forward. vocals sound a bit thin and snares sound a little sharp. actually a bit annoying to my ears but I tend to be treble sensitive.\n\ntreble: great as you would suspect from audiophile tuning. well extended and controlled but do weirdly get harsh for me. again, I'm a bit sensitive to treble so YMMV with that.\n\n**PX7 S3:**\n\ntuning: very bloated bass. maybe you'll like it if you're a basshead. good extension into sub bass but a bit less controlled than the px8 and 630 but still pretty good.\n\nspace and technicalities: worst of the bunch but still pretty good and pleasant to the ears. I only really notice they're worse after listening to the other headphones. both the px8 and 630 extract more detail and sound more spacious and 3D.\n\nbass: way bloated. strong and good extension into sub bass\n\nmids: my favorite here actually. sounds intimate and full. smooth and fun tuning. not shouty.\n\ntreble: my favorite also. sounds well extended and airy but not overly so. doesn't get sharp or shouty. maybe a tad rolled off and recessed compared to true audiophile tuning but to my ear they are close to just right. very pleasant sounding. the treble adds a bit of nice air and sparkle without getting annoying.\n\n**Px8 S2:**\n\ntuning: I would still consider these bass bloated but less so than the px7. mids feel a tiny bit more recessed than the px7 but more present and forward than the 630. more treble presence than the px7. maybe about the same as the 630 but sounds less shouty.\n\nspace and technicalities: very good here. better 3D space and detail than the px7. bass is tighter and transients feels slightly snappier than the px7. similar to the 630 in terms of space and detail but again, the B&Ws feel closer and more \"fun\".\n\nbass: my favorite bass of the three. still sounds bloated to me but less so than the px7. more balanced and controlled than the px7. definitely way more power here than the 630 without EQing.\n\nmids: very good. tiny bit recessed compared to the px7. sounds smooth and balanced.\n\ntreble: very good here. well controlled and extended but still sounds smooth. about the same presence as the 630 but sounds more balanced to me.\n\n**what I'm keeping?**\n\nto my surprise, I think I'm keeping the Px7 S3. I'm hoping the band loosens a bit. the ANC is pretty good especially with airplane noise. the B&W styling is very attractive. mids and highs are great and tuned to my liking. sense of space and technicalities are still very good and pleasant to listen to. and for now, I have the low bass down 3.5 and mid bass down 2.0 and they sound less bloated.",

Should i order 2 just incase? Lol but im guessing the unopened earbuds are still having they battery drained by just existing anyways?",

    "title": "3 year Review of the Audeze LCD-X (Post 2021 Version)",
    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

While I think the ATs beat them in imaging, it isn’t that big of a difference. They are less comfortable, don’t have any bass, build quality feels cheap. \n\nI tried them with BF6 and while it was immersive, the moment I put on the 490s after these the difference was apparent. The velour pads work well with my glasses and are way more comfortable than the audio technicas. \n\nI also tried listening to some music, namely BRAT because I love the production on that album and these lacked any sort of punch. I have SONY MDR MV1s coming in tomorrow, will see how they hold up against what I already have. Looking for something more V shaped and lush compared to the 560s sound signature and I’ve heard that the mv1s fit that description well. If they don’t I might return the 490s, R70xas and MV1s and skipping mid fi completely and move to some Hi Fi offerings like Clears/Meze 109 pro/FT7 (because I want to try planars). Any other suggestions are welcome, looking for open backs with a big soundstage as well as a bass boost. Not too concerned with neutrality. ",

Meh bass. OK soundstage/imaging. Boring.\n\n3.) **Beyerdynamic TYGR 300R**:\n\nI've had a couple Beyers in the past and used to daily a modded set of DT770/250ohm.

Audeze Maxwell + Momentum 4 for $50 more (can be less if you're cool with open box) do more things better.\n\n**The positives:**\n\n* **One of the best ever sounding closed backs**, definitely the best I've heard with ANC (vs Bathys, XM5/XM6, Momentum 4, QC Ultra, Airpods Max), competes with or beats many wired closed backs. I think they fall just short of Audeze Maxwell with some EQ adjustments, but those headphones are very close to my tastes out of the box so YMMV.\n* Pairs great tuning with anatomy measurements to normalize low end performance between different users and re-seating.\n* **PEQ** to dial in to your tastes\n* **Low latency** (matched my monitor's input lag near identically in gaming mode by my perception))and high res Bluetooth connections with the dongle. I think Sennheiser are getting close to or even beating that 30ms latency in the low latency dongle mode\n* **The sound with the dongle is excellent**, even in the low latency mode\n* Solid all around functionality as a portable ANC headphone\n\n**The negatives:**\n\n* **Comfort is not great**. Fairly shallow pads that compress easily cause heat and pressure on the pinna, and I don't have big ears. They (and Momentum 4) also have an odd cup angle that requires you to rotate the headband forward which is sub-optimal. For comparison, I find the Bathys comfier in the pads but slightly less comfy in the headband. I hate the XM5/XM6 comfort-wise, 630 are an improvement. APM are comfier and QC Ultra are much much comfier.\n* The WC Freeze pads for Momentum 4 fit and are way comfier but hurt the seal a lot (which makes ANC and sound both much worse) making those pads a complete no-go IMO.\n* No 2.4GHz on the dongle\n* Finicky pairing and touch controls. Same issues as Momentum 4.\n* **No ability to use the mic + get full sound quality at the same time**\n* No options for a boom mic\n* **Boring looking and no color options,** and they are a bit too thick in the cups to look normal vs other ANC.\n* **Expensive**: **You can get a pair of Momentum 4 + an Audeze Maxwell for $50 more**, and less than the price of the HDB 630 if you are willing to do refurbs/open box. Maxwell is comfier to me (weight doesn't bother me, capra strap improves even more) and sounds better + has the boom mic and low latency via 2.4ghz. Momentum 4 sounds pretty good with the built in graphic EQ and not that much worse than HDB 630 if you use another app for PEQ.\n\n**Deeper Sound Breakdown**: These headphones were very quickly determined to be not worth the money for me, so these impressions are not my most thorough. As with all sound impressions, YMMV.\n\n* **Tuning**\n   * They are **a bit mid-bass focused** for me, sounding a bit bloated in the low end. Luckily the blending into the mids is very clean and not boomy. The extension is good, but the midbass focus also reduces how apparent this is\n   * **The mids are very nice.** Perhaps a bit lacking in energy, but this can be fixed with a peak filter most likely somewhere between 1-3k. I often find 2-2.5k helps with this a lot.\n   * **They are very natural sounding in timbre**. This is the one thing that they solidly beat the Momentum 4 at even with the M4 dialed in with the in-app EQ.\n   * **The treble very even and pleasant albeit** maybe a tad too relaxed for me.\n* **Technicalities**\n   * **Bass texture is lacking.** Even with a filter reigning in the midbass, they lacked the grit and texture in the low-end that I really look for in a headphone\n   * **Treble is a bit oversmoothed, leading to a perceived lack of resolution**. This may actually be affecting the bass texture situation.\n   * **They aren't that punchy or energetic**. The midbass focus and a bit of relaxed 1-3k lead to a bit of dullness. Kick drums don't impact as nicely as I'd like, and higher voices don't come through as strongly as I think they should.\n   * **They are a well-controlled but not super 'fast'.** Especially with the bass reduced, they do give the impression of not being sloppy or slow, but they aren't super quick in terms of attack or decay.\n   * **A note about imaging/soundstage**: I am a speaker guy first and foremost. I don't get any impression of verticality or layering from any headphones unless the music is mastered specifically with headphones and spaciousness in mind. I find that production to be very rare. The things I do notice are imaging and distance. **The imaging is good; t**his is mostly just down to consistent channel matching across the FR. **Spaciousness is exactly what you'd expect.** They aren't completely inside my head, but they give no impression the sound is coming from a distance outside of the headphone. This is typical for me for closed backs.\n* **EQ Suggestions:**\n   * Peak filter around 120hz, q\\~1, -1-3db to get rid of the bass bloat\n   * If you are more of a bass roll-off fan, do a bass shelf with 2-5db reduction.\n   * Find the area between 1-3k that increasing with a q filter of \\~1 by 1-3db gives you more energy and punch.\n   * Find any over-emphasis in the low treble, 3-7k and reduce that if needed.\n   * See if you have any aggressive peaks above 5k, and reduce them with smaller q value filters\n   * Add a treble shelf to boost detail if needed.\n\n**Summary:** excellent sound especially with PEQ, mediocre comfort, boring design that looks a bit bulky on head, good latency and sound via dongle, no boom mic, sound is bad when using mic, and pricey vs a dedicated ANC + dedicated gaming headphone. I like the Maxwell + Momentum 4 enough to make it a no-go for me. **But if the mic situation and comfort are good for you, they're very hard to beat as an all-around single solution.**",

Look if you can spend 500 plus tax on a pair of cans and sound is the most important feature to you it's no brainer my issue kinda everything else. They are comfortable and have decent ANC. For the price though the build is a little disappointing. They silver plastic yokes look a little goofy and I hat ethe fact the ear pads are pleather like yes they are nicer than most for that but I am really upgrading from a momentum 3 which had sheepskin leather pads that are still in great condition 7 years later but these will peel eventually which is sad. Also the size adjustment on the yokes is too loose it gets out of shape easily just jumping is enough to cause a shift. The main reason I'm making this though is that I've realized in my upgrade path from my mm3 I really just wanted better anc the sq in it's probably EQ was good enough and the build was great so it's been kinda disappointing finding all these options are always worse is some or more ways. Like I first bought the focal clear mg( don't have a pic because somehow I forgot take a pic of or I can't find it) which was built and sounded great but the anc boomed a bit when you walked and the suede headband is a bad choice on a headphone I plan to use and abuse so I returned it after a week. Then I decided to get a px8 which. Is builder well* but sounds like doodoo like it's fine for yt but music just sounds wrong most of the time. It was comfortable but the leather\" they use is like as thin as possible so it feels like pleather. And now these. \n\nFor reference I own and have owned audeze Maxwell, LCD 4 Sennheiser hd6xx hd800 mm3 HDB 630 Sony ier z1r, focal clear mg, neaumann kh120  and have owned LCD 2, abyss Diana tc, focal bathys mg and tin p1. The expensive stuff I buy used because it's usually 50% less. So I feel I have a decent ground to stand on I've also heard most good headphones besides hifiman stuff. My personal favorite is a Harmon auto eq like setting for my LCD 4. But recently with these bathys mg and HDB 630 and Maxwell all overall have similar tuning to be in the hrt preference curve. For me when I hear these music sounds right and correct and good but just eh like when I hear it in not blown away ever so maybe it's because I have such nice stuff that the other stuff doesn't excite but it's been kinda a downer and why I don't mind the px8 as much  though again to be clear I don't enjoy music on it. But like I have tried Bose qc and they sounded like they were underwater so if I was used to that and tried any of these I can see why they are incredible. Basically my recommendation is buy the best you can afford and don't buy anything else as usually you are disappointed lol. But yeah as a review they are great a little bulky and the yokes have a rattle in hand but not on head and they stick out so far that even with wind mode on their is wind noise when walking from the great walks protruding from your ears. If you have any questions lmk happy to answer. Also I got to say the bathys mg are not worth 1300 or 1500 if you find them used for 400-600 then I would start considering it is definitely a nice pair of cans just not built to the 1500 price even remotely but at least it has leather pads. I might get the px8 s2 if I decide to return these sennys btw the senns have marginally better anc than px8 and no boom when walking but the Bose qc stomps all over both for anc. Best headphone I've probably ever heard is either my LCD 4 or an dca Corina on a blue Hawaii that I hear at my local hifi shop.",

    "selftext": "Just got these in and wow — out of the box they sound superb. The tuning is really neutral and everything comes together seamlessly. The bass has great extension and presence — it adds solid weight and heft to the music without bleeding into the mids or muddying up vocals. Speaking of vocals, they’re insanely clear, super natural, and have that spot-on timbre Sennheiser does so well. Instruments sound very lifelike with great clarity and separation too.\n\nTreble is crisp and airy but never harsh or fatiguing. The soundstage is actually excellent for a closed-back set, and imaging is really precise. Nothing sounds congested or stacked on top of each other — everything has its space.\n\nHaven’t played much with the included BTD 700 dongle yet, but it’s nice that they include it so you can stream the highest-quality codecs without worrying about your source.\n\nNoise cancelling is surprisingly solid. Not quite on Bose or Sony’s level, but still really competitive. For an audiophile-focused headphone, it’s impressive how well the ANC works — definitely good enough for a commute, plane ride, or office use. It makes it possible to enjoy this kind of sound in places where you normally couldn’t.\n\nBuild quality is good, but I do wish they used a bit more premium materials given the $500 price tag. That said, heavier materials usually hurt comfort, and these are actually really comfortable. Tons of padding, no sore spots after a few hours. The earcups do push up slightly on my ears but not painfully so. They do get warm after a while, though. Comfort overall isn’t quite on the level of the Bose QC Ultra Gen 2, but it’s not far behind — way better than the Sony WH-1000XM6, which leave my ears sore because of those shallow cups and the ANC mic placement.\n\nBattery life is nuts — 60 hours. You can go several days without even thinking about charging. The touch controls work fine once you get used to them, but they can be finicky. I’d still rather have real buttons personally.\n\nCall quality is actually decent too. Not AirPods-level, but totally usable and better than I expected for an audiophile-first product.\n\nOverall, I’m really loving these so far. They sound absolutely fantastic — clean, balanced, natural — and they’re super versatile with ANC, long battery life, and wireless convenience.\n\n**TL;DR:** HDB 630s sound fantastic — super neutral, clear, and natural with deep but clean bass, lifelike vocals, and crisp treble. Soundstage and imaging are excellent for closed-backs. ANC is solid (not Bose/Sony level but very usable), comfort is good though a bit warm over time, and build feels fine but could be more premium for $500. Battery life is insane at 60 hours, touch controls are okay once you get used to them, and call quality’s surprisingly decent. Overall: audiophile-grade sound meets real-world practicality.",

    "selftext": "I am a regular music listener and always use my headphones to do so, however using them for a long time builds up a lot of earwax which often completely shuts off my ear after waking up. The mesh around it too get earwax on them, needing to clean them every few days.  \nIt's just become a regular routine for me to clean off my earwax atleast once a day to avoid getting my ears shut off due to the wax. Was not too confident with hydrogen peroxide, so got an ear camera cleaning tool by bebird, and honestly it is quite good to use.  \nThe scoop is silicone based so i dont feel much sceptical about it to not put in my ear... However for my headphones i dont have any solution to the wax which gets stuck on the mesh, even after trying to get it off by toothpick and small objects it just stays there. Removing it would obviously damage the pre glued seal which would have to be reapplied then. Any suggestions for removing the earwax from the mesh of the headphone..?",

    "selftext": "DO NOT RECOMMEND OR PURCHASE!!\n\nThe Heavys H1H headphones, marketed for metal fans with an eight-driver design, promised durability and premium sound for $485. Instead, they delivered a flimsy build, muddy audio, and abysmal customer service, making this purchase a complete letdown.\nDurability: Shockingly Fragile\nThe website claims the H1H survived 1.8m drops onto hard floors, but this is a blatant lie. My headphones’ headband snapped in two after a mere 0.4m drop onto a soft carpeted floor. For a premium product, this fragility is outrageous. The 308g weight also made them uncomfortable for extended wear, and the satin finish attracted fingerprints, further cheapening the experience.\n\nCustomer Service: Insulting Response,\n\nWhen I contacted Heavys about the broken headband, their response was slow and unhelpful. After days of generic emails, they offered a 25% discount on another purchase. Why would I buy a faulty product again? This dismissive attitude left me feeling cheated and ignored.\n\nSound and Features: Substandard,\n\nThe sound was bass-heavy and muddy, burying vocals and guitars in tracks like Iron Maiden’s Run to the Hills. The app’s EQ barely helped, and the soundstage felt cramped. The “Hell Blocker” noise cancellation was ineffective against basic background noise, and clunky buttons made adjustments a hassle.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Heavys H1H are a massive disappointment. A fragile build, false durability claims, poor sound, and insulting customer service make these headphones a waste of money. Metal fans, steer clear and invest in something reliable.",

    "selftext": "**Without EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth: best all rounder, widest soundstage, great imaging, superior separation, hefty bass\n2. Arya Stealth: sterile, thin sounding, decent bass\n3. HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be £3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it’s tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For “heavier” music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that’s clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It’s an excellent headphone and if you don’t AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

However I did have the DT770, but that treble peakness was something else! After this, I dipped my toes into IEMs and bought the Letshuoer S12s which are similar to the EXS and I absolutely was wowed by these. Now I have the Arya Organics which imo are an upgraded EXS. \n\nNot all my headphones are bright. I do also own the FT1 and the Audio Punch Martilo IEMs. ",

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n·        FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n·        FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n·        FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n·        FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n·        FiiO KA11.\n\n·        FiiO JA11.\n\n·        MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n·        Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n·        Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n·        Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n·        Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**€13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 €/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of €30 than one of €100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but…\n\n…let's start with the **package content:**\n\n·        The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n·        User manual\n\n·        A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n·        A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n·        The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the €13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n·        A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n·        Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n·        Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n·        Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but… the highs got easily out of control…\n\n… I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is… somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child’s voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors’ behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies’ guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **€13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n ",

    "selftext": "Hi, I have recently aquired Arya Stealth headphones and don't plan to buy much else cause they are fantastic in most situations. However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos?

Been A/B ing them both and all I can say is that the sound signatures are similar but the Aryas just do everything better. I was listening to my go to testing track Dreams by Fleetwood Mac and song just felt livelier. Stevie Nicks' voice had more character, the kick drums had presence and everything felt musical. The treble is spicy, but in not treble sensitive and actually prefer (call me crazy). The sound stage is bigger too!\n\nI am using these with my Ifi Neo Idsd that using the Burr Brown for reference and power these with ease. \n\nMy edition XS has been great for the last 3 years, but it's time to retire/sell them.

Outside of some Bose about 15+ years ago, I’ve never had occasion to be near NC Headphones. \n\nAnyway, I popped these on and EVERYTHING went dead silent.

In that crazy, crowded, noisy store I heard nothing but soft cool jazz. I could see my wife’s lips moving but could hear a word and it was pure bliss. Not sure which model I had but they were like $500+ at the time. \n\nQ: Anything BETTER, or cheaper yet still super isolating and effective these days?

Especially the high-quality bass. But one thing that made me really happy as a customer is the accessories you get. When I bought much more expensive headphones, they don't treat you as good as FiiO. You get the regular 3.5mm cable with 6.35mm adapter but also a premium looking case and A BALANCED 4.4MM CABLE! Amazing headphones with amazing accessories. all for an amazing price. It's super convenient because I always wanted a balanced cable for my HD 600 and Edition XS but they are quite expensive. The fact that FiiO included them is just really nice. Now I can use them for my Edition XS without having to go out and look and spend money on them.\n\nThis really reminds me of how cheap smartphones gives you more than $1000 smartphones. You get a screen protector already applied, a free phone case included in the box and of course a should-be-mandatory charging brick.

    "selftext": "To start off, these are such incredible cans. It took some effort to tweak them, but once successful, they were just *amazing*.\n\n**Build quality and comfort:**\n\n* The weight is one thing many people talk about, and its not unwarranted. It weighs around 635g, which is over triple the weight of my previous headphones, the R70X. It does tire your neck a bit after around 2 hours of use, so **make sure you have a strong neck**!\n* The pads are plump, with a leathery feel. Very comfortable, and it won't press against your head that much.\n* The head strap did stretch over the years, but it was a simple fix of making new holes and shortening the strap.\n* Now, *while* the cans themselves are bulletproof, my biggest worry is the screw connecting them to the headband. It's quite small, so it's definitely a weak point of the headphone.\n\n**Sound and EQ:**\n\n* This is where you need to invest a little effort into tweaking just right. With stock tuning, these cans are actually pretty mediocre. No bass, tinny sound, weak and distant. BUT, with proper EQ, **these shine like never before.**\n\nMy Peace EQ settings (I like a bit of V Curve):     [https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt](https://imgur.com/a/af3XeZt)\n\n* **I mean, WOW.** The bass, especially when eq'd up, feels similar to being at a concert. The whole headphone feels as if it's shaking, and the lows reach all the way down uniformly. The punch and rumble is clean, and there is basically no muddiness or bloat I could hear. It's meaty, and it shows well in songs with a lot in the low end.\n* The highs and mids sound warm, not clinical and cold. It also leaned a bit dark, though the detail was surprisingly good!\n* The soundstage is a bit small, and also vocals and treble don't sound as magical as something like an Arya would sound, but the intimate feeling of the headphone makes up for that.\n* These headphones are **fun**!! They are definitely meant for exciting, groovy and energetic songs.\n\nI paired these cans with the JDS Labs ATOM Amp, and so far the have not let me down.\n\n*Unfortunately,* as well with most endgame headphones, diminishing returns hit strong and fast. While these are no doubt a upgrade, I would say the sound of the Audio Technica R70x, a much cheaper headphone, are like **75%** of the way there to the LCDX sound quality. I still think these are worth the 1k price though, as the bass is leagues better. Your mileage will vary though.\n\nAround a year ago, my LCD-X suffered a malfunction with the left side, where it stopped playing completely. I contacted Audeze through email, and they took my headphones in and sent me a replacement for absolutely free! Their customer support was fast and friendly, and made the process completely painless, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I think these cans are absolutely worth it. They are a bit heavy, and it does take some playing with EQ to make it work, but once it does, they perform **amazingly.**\n\n  \nEdit: Seems I created confusion with my EQ settings! It seems like an extreme V Curve, but this is due to the LCD-X's odd tuning, for which the Harman curve (I consider this the neutral starting point) adds a natural boost in the bass and treble. In reality, my EQ gives the LCD-X a standard  V Curve, not an extreme one as some assumed in the comments.",

HE6se V2: less refined than Arya Stealth, very neutral and clinical, honky and boxy telephone-like sound (some may prefer this), very fast and dynamic.\n\n**With EQ**\n\n1. HE1000 Stealth (does not require EQ): still the best allrounder\n2. HE6se V2: very natural and smooth, great 3D sound with slightly less stage size than Arya Sealth, more weight and slam, excellent midrange, amazing separation\n3. Arya Stealth: fuller and richer but less emphasis than HE6 in many ways, slightly more balanced and smoother, good overall sound for a number of different use cases\n\nBoth the HE6se V2 (EQ'd) and HE1000 Stealth trade blows. It's definitely no slouch and ever so slightly prefer it over the HE1000 Stealth with certain genres such as rock and metal. For everything else including classical music, and videogame/movie OST's such as LOTR, Skyrim, Oblivion, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3 etc. the HE1000 Stealth is the overall winner, including Rap and Hip-Hop.\n\nThe most noticeable factors of the HE1000 Stealth over the Arya Stealth is note weight and staging. Yes there may not be a drastic difference in sound signature because that's just Hifiman's house sound, but it is definitely noticeable. Overall more smooth and natural with better detail retrieval. You could say it's more resolving than the Arya Stealth.\n\nThe Arya Stealth is no longer an option when it comes to music and recently started being used only for multiplayer gaming and browsing. Anyone who hasn't tried the HE1000 Stealth I would highly consider saving slightly more or even sell the Arya Stealth or use the Hifiman trade program for the HE1000 Stealth. It is a superior uplift in performance, non fatiguing, doesn't require EQ, and punches way above its current price (used to be £3k at one point). I reckon my headphone days are pretty much done for a very very long time. It's been slightly over a year between acquiring the Arya Stealth and now the HE1000 Stealth which has enabled me to appreciate and savour the sound much more.",

    "selftext": "I was lucky to have a pair of Edition XS to A/B compare against an Arya Stealth for metal music.\n\n\nBefore I get into sound impressions, it’s tre that the headband of the Arya is much more comfortable than the Edition XS. I read somewhere that one can buy a separate headband and mod the XS and then the comfort should be identical to the Arya. But by default the Arya trumps in comfort. The rest of the build is identical.\n\nSound wise, they are very similar, especially in bass. However, the Arya is definitely more resolving in the mid-highs. You can pick out details very easily, things you never heard before. \n\nFor metal music, that can actually be a problem. Many tracks were hard to listen to on the Arya as the high hats can come out too shrill. Especially if you listen to metal from the 80s or poorly mastered tracks. I found the XS to be more muted and more easy to enjoy, even though they also had some trouble on the same metal tracks.\n\nHowever, when A/Bing them, I found that I was missing the resolution and clarity of the Aryas. I prefer treble generally, so for Tool, heavy metal, death and similar music I found the Aryas were better. For “heavier” music though, like doom, stoner etc., I thought the XS was more fun/easy to listen to.\n\nI decided to keep the Aryas for now and EQ them a bit to get more bass and tame the highs a little. Hopefully that gives an experience that’s clearer than the XS while not inducing earaches.\n\nSummary: if you are strapped for money, try the XS. It’s an excellent headphone and if you don’t AB you will not realise anything is missing. \nIf you have the extra cash, and you are willing to EQ, the Arya might be a better bet, especially if you like clarity and high resolution in your music. I will be trying them out some more and seeing how that goes. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you agree or have any questions? Let me know :-)\n\n",

Regardless of what experts, reviews or anyone what is saying: what is your perfect pair of headphones? \n\nI used to have a pair of first generation Sennheiser Momentum but then due to working from home and getting a Jabra Evolve 75 SE from my company for calls I stopped using them and somehow lost them. \n\nRecently there came a point, though, where I got sick and tired from listening to music on them. I had a pair of DT 770s and tried them out and they were great. Good passive noise isolation, comfortable, great sound. \n\nStill, I looked around and after reading forums, reddits, review sites, rtings, Amirm's recommendations I settled on the AKG K371 and man... I was blown away.\n\nThey are incredibly comfortable, completely cupping my ears and silencing the high pitched fans of my laptop even when it gets busier, and they have such great sound. It's incredible. I didn't know about the Harman curve but one of the things that was weird on the DT770s was the sharp high notes that were especially prominent when listening to Michael Ponti playing on the Hammerklavier. Still an incredible sound, though.\n\nBut the K371s went even one step further, so much so that I found new joy when listening to Vivaldi's overplayed Spring.

    "title": "CCA CRA+: pure fun at a ridiculous price.",
    "selftext": "Hello Community!\n\nThis time it's the review of a low-cost product, but just because it costs little money doesn't mean we should forget about this range. In fact: the cheaper they are, the less I expect from them, and if they perform well and beyond expectations, the joy received is greater than if it were a more expensive product.\n\nIt's the turn of CCA CRA+, a review of the popular model from the brand, launched in 2022.\n\nI know: I'm not up to date with the models I show you, but just because they are a few years old doesn't mean they should be forgotten.\n\nAs in every analysis, I present my sources:\n\n·        FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.\n\n·        FiiO KA13 while working.\n\n·        FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.\n\n·        FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.\n\n·        FiiO KA11.\n\n·        FiiO JA11.\n\n·        MacBook Air M4 3.5mm output.\n\n·        Amazon Music Ultimate.\n\n·        Local FLAC and MP3 files.\n\nIf you don't want to keep reading, here are the Pros and Cons:\n\n·        Pros:  \n\\-Tremendously energetic.  \n\\-Bass with great punch and control.  \n\\-Airy high region.  \n\\-Detailed acoustics.  \n\\-Excellent sound quality/price ratio.\n\n·        Cons:  \n\\-The hardness of the ear tips may bother some.  \n\\-The best results I obtained were with a DAC/AMP.  \n\\-Layering sometimes confusing.  \n\\-For this price, we find better materials.  \n\\-If you change ear tips and cable, you improve the product.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThese IEMs were purchased with my own money (**€13**), and my priority, as in every analysis, is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product.\n\nThese are my opinions, but if you have others, they are equally valid. Be free to share them to enrich the conversation.\n\nThat said, the brutality with which competition occurs in this price range (I have my own ranges) of 0-20 €/$ is totally fierce, but you truly find gems that can satisfy both the most demanding and experienced, as well as those beginners who intend to get into the hobby or simply improve their sound.\n\nI do not deny it: I like buying a lot and cheap. I like having things and trying and trying and trying. I prefer to have 3 monitors of €30 than one of €100.\n\nHave I hit the mark with these **CCA CRA+**? Let's see, but…\n\n…let's start with the **package content:**\n\n·        The product is presented in the typical box for monitors at this price. Simple design, no complications, with a cover that we remove to access the interior.\n\n·        User manual\n\n·        A set of ear tips in different sizes.\n\n·        A cable with 3.5mm termination\n\n·        The two capsules, made of plastic with a golden front plate that I cannot distinguish if it is an alloy or another type of plastic. They have air pressure reliefs, 0.78mm 2-pin connections, and the nozzle filter is made of plastic.\n\n\n\n**What do you say about comfort?**\n\nThe general sensation obtained is that everything is consistent with its price: cheap and low-quality materials. Is this bad? Not necessarily if the sound it delivers satisfies you. I don't consider that I can reproach the brand for the €13 these **CRA+** cost.\n\nThe ear tips may be hard, and they are, but they fit well and do not hurt.\n\nThe cable is bad, tremendously rigid, but yes, it does not tangle while walking, and I appreciate that, as I spend a lot of time outside the house walking or doing sports. Sitting at the desk, comfort decreased a bit, as sometimes a shape remains, which can hinder keyboard use or hit your hand.\n\nThe capsules are finished with precision, without noticing faults in their manufacturing. They are comfortable in the ear, with sufficient width and length in the nozzles to facilitate a firm and secure seal. They do not tire, they do not exert pressure on the ear canal or auricle. You can wear them for hours, and when you remove them, your ears will not be red.\n\nDespite everything, I have used all stock accessories without discomfort. They are not of high quality and it is obvious, but they are fully functional, and I applaud that a set of IEMs can be used satisfactorily without using third-party accessories (unlike the Kiwi Ears Cadenza).\n\n**Technical features:**\n\n·        A 10mm compound polymer Dynamic Driver (1DD).\n\n·        Impedance of 16 ohms.\n\n·        Sensitivity of 111 dB.\n\n·        Frequency range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.\n\nAt the risk of being stoned for opposing opinions, these **CRA+** need amplification.\n\nThe monitors improve macro details in any frequency range. Much or little? I could not say for sure what to recommend, but I can affirm that without it they are IEMs that do not stand out in anything, and I do not find that differential factor to choose them over others.\n\nAt medium gain, I found a perfect point between body in lows and detail in highs. At high gain, I found a better-defined midrange and a low range as I like it; well-bodied and dominant, but… the highs got easily out of control…\n\n… I chose to stay at **medium gain** for my listening and to make this analysis.\n\n**Sound signature:**\n\nWe have a V-shaped signature with some moderation. Or so says the graph, anyway. Just as I don't take measurements, I also don't question them. I only interpret what my ears feel and express my opinions.\n\nAnyway, as I said; I find intentionally boosted bass, a midrange that seems a little present but maintains identity, and highs that seem to touch the sky but are at the perfect point between annoying and roll-off.\n\n**Sub-bass:** offers a strong response, not with absolute prominence but felt if needed, with a smooth and controlled decay, leaving space for other frequencies without intrusions that muddy acoustic and vocal listening.\n\n**Bass:** detailed, resolutive, impactful, fast. They hit and go. Well, it seems I love them. Yes. I adore them, it's absurd to deny it.\n\n**Lower mids:** we enter swampy territory. While it is true I find definition in some instruments, I can appreciate detail in very low voices and some desire to share protagonism in general, this area is not its strong point as it thickens the mix and gives a chaotic feeling, making listening to drums or electric bass somewhat muddy.\n\n**Mids**: here the **CCA** monitor stands out, but let's stay calm. Let's start because in tracks where these frequencies are focused, vocal and tonal clarity is perceived better. Voices sound coherent, sound good, do not really stand out but do not draw attention by sounding bad, and that is very respectable. The tonal balance is adequate, but we cannot throw rockets. This area is far from seeming sunken or little present.\n\n**Upper mids:** here the boost is noticeable, especially the voices in this range. Female voices, especially, provide naturalness among instrumentation that sounds energetic and detailed, sounding airy and with excellent timbre.\n\n**Highs:** I had to control this with amplification. They seemed annoying from the 3.5mm connection; however, at medium gain things improved, as I said above, perceiving a listening capable of offering energy, very good expansion and enough detail, but above all, control.\n\nRegarding **soundstage**, moderate is the word. In width, it is not bad, I would say above average. In depth and height, it is quite compressed, indeed. It does not give the feeling of being narrow, but it is not an extensive and green meadow of freedom either.\n\n**Layering** is… somewhat confusing. It depends on what you listen to, of course. In orchestral and choral music, this will be seen as a weakness as congestion is perceived, but in classic rock, which is my favorite genre, it honestly does not perform badly. Obviously, the more elements are playing, the worse performance will be in this **CRA+**.\n\nEven so, **imaging** is a very notable point in these monitors. It feels precise, and it is easy to position what sounds on the stage.\n\nRegarding **detail retrieval**, its tuning favors this aspect, although with nuances depending on the musical genre you are listening to. Transients are fast, yes, but the driver's capabilities are not the most optimal to handle dense tracks with a midrange that does not want to stay sunken.\n\nLet's move on to single-player video games. Relax, no spoilers.\n\nI suggest you access the [following link](https://hifijuegos.blogspot.com/p/como-analizo-el-audio.html) on my blog to understand the conditions under which I analyze headphone sound in this field.\n\nThe source used was my classic **FiiO K11** at medium gain and filter No. 5, which offers a wide and flat response.\n\nIn **Baldur's Gate III**, the open-field scene is very useful to draw conclusions about scene three-dimensionality and element positioning.\n\nWell, as I said before, the soundstage feels limited. I do not like to embellish it with the word intimate. The **CRA+** is certainly limited, and 3D width is not its strong point, bringing sound closer in a cramped way. It does not reach the point of sounding artificial, but sounds that should be heard far away are heard as if they were next to you or in front of you.\n\nHowever, the placement of these sounds is worthy of praise. It positions well the direction from which they come, being able to mentally trace the route they follow and guess where they will appear in the scene.\n\nRegarding handling chaotic sound scenes in **Doom**, this **CCA** monitor performed well. The driver behaved well, providing adequate layering that clearly revealed music, gunshots, explosions, and screams. I cannot claim that resolution was entirely sharp, but I did not feel a mass without coherence.\n\nIn the bass and male low-voice speed test in **Batman Arkham Knight**, wow, I really enjoyed the few times I played this passage. It reaches a very good point of spectacularity, showing powerful and electric impact in hits, with just enough rumble in its extension necessary to elevate the action of the moment.\n\nThe character's voice articulated exemplary, feeling a deep timbre and detail that revealed authentic naturalness.\n\nRegarding dialogues, one scene that puts it to the test or at least should, is this from **A Plague Tale Requiem**, where an adult female voice, a child, and a teenage voice converge.\n\nWell, regarding the female voice, it may seem a bit thin, but the clarity it offers is satisfactory.\n\nThe child’s voice I found somewhat bright, bordering sibilance, but it still sounded natural and detailed.\n\nThe teenage voice, which coincides with the **CRA+** midrange, has appropriate body and balance, exactly what one should expect in this vocal range.\n\nMoving on to the extreme treble test in **Final Fantasy XVI**, I found a performance that I somewhat expected: it would lack brilliance, but with a subtle energetic touch that adds fun. The different sounds of crackling spells and sword strikes on metal surfaces are airy and easily recognizable in the mix as they remain controlled at all times.\n\nRegarding ambient **microdetail**, necessary for immersion, these monitors’ behavior was satisfactory.\n\nIn **Resident Evil 4 Remake**, the sensation I got was that footsteps, both mine and enemies', were present and well positioned; reverberation when passing through tunnels was represented accurately, the articulation of zombies’ guttural and breathing sounds offered detail and clarity, and in general traits, any sound element added value and was not lost among layers; therefore, credit must be given for good work.\n\n**Final conclusions:**\n\nI will start with the easy part: I can recommend them for single-player video games without risk of being wrong, as they provide adequate immersion thanks to the representation of those subtleties we never pay attention to but which add to the final experience when enjoying video games.\n\nThey are still spectacular, as in action moments, they show excellent behavior with hit bass, showing muscle and speed. Perhaps I miss more sub-bass punch, which was not very extended in my tests, but these are simply personal tastes.\n\nRegarding dialogues, they were represented coherently and satisfactorily. I cannot say they are an explosion of resolution, but they maintain naturalness and presence to enjoy the narrative.\n\nOn the other hand, in music, they are recommendable for certain genres, such as classic rock or where not many instruments are involved. Even in pop songs where voices may take the lead, these **CCAs** perform very well, showing great detail.\n\nThey are IEMs that, in general terms, leave a good taste: fun in lows and energetic in highs. However, I must remind that the source matters: they need a bit of amplification power to get the best results.\n\nI think that with better-quality ear tips, for example, the **Candy** from **DUNU**, they would gain more impact in low frequencies, slightly delay the mids, and improve the soundstage. I have tried it, and the product is quite different and better, but one must be honest and analyze the whole set without having to buy third-party accessories.\n\nEven so, gentlemen, they cost **€13**. They give many more satisfactions than they should for that price.\n\n**Greetings**, and see you in the next review!\n\n ",

However, I do listen to lots of metal, and in some tracks, especially more chaotic with lots going on or just old and badly mixed - Aryas get a little bit harsh. Equalizer works great but it also kinda kills the beautiful detail on other songs, so it feels like a compromise. I can get used to switching equalizer settings but I can also afford another pair of headphones, that would be used for more casual listening or metal in general. \n\nBudget is flexible if it's worth it. I've been thinking about HD490Pro or HD660S2 (listened to both in a shop nearby, sounded nice and relaxed, but plastic build felt a bit cheap), maybe audeze LCD-2c (didn't get to listen to). It has to be different to be worth it, probably warmer, more forgiving, less harsh, but still a good hi-fi headphones. Any opinions are welcome!",

Love the flat bass response down to like 20hz, no roll off. I think the treble is perfect for me and I don’t think vocals are too far back in the mix at all.\n\nI’ve had Sundara and Ananda in the past, as well as LCD 2C.\n\nWhile I never thought the Hifimans were overly piercing or too treble forward, I think the XV is definitely closer to the 2C in terms of overall tonality.\n\nWill definitely be keeping these.\n\nAre they better than 6xx? Out of the box yes but with EQ bass shelf on 6xx it gets much closer. They complement them well. 6xx is more of an intimate sound, XV is more spacious.\n\nKick drums and high hat sound perfect IMO. Love it\n\nOne weird thing I noticed....I always run through freq sweeps and tone generators every once in awhile to make sure there is no driver buzzing or other weird stuff going on.\n\nWith these Edition XV, there is no driver buzzing. However, when running the tone generator on squig.link I notice there is a tone within the tone at various frequencies. Not sure what that's about.\n\n300hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n1700hz - right channel there is tone issue\n\n4000hz - left channel there are two seperate freqs coming through\n\n4900hz - right channel tone issue\n\nWould I have ever noticed just listening to music and watching videos? No. But now that I know it's there...\n\nI'll use for a couple weeks and see if it goes away.",

    "selftext": "I normally play on PC (preferred system) but am traveling internationally for the next couple of weeks so have had to resort to Steam Deck. It's an amazing piece of hardware but has always struggled with Helldivers 2.\n\nFinally decided to do some research into actual verified solutions/tweaks that would at least get the game at a locked 40 FPS without hitching/stuttering.\n\nI made four changes:\n\n1. Set graphics preset to the \"Steam Deck ™️\" profile\n\n2. Set Sharpness to .70 (this is personal preference, doesn't affect performance)\n\n3. Boot into the BIOS (don't panic, it's like three clicks in the BIOS GUI), change VRAM pre-allocated amount from the default of 1GB to 2GB. Some posts say do 4GB but I wanted to test results with a slight bump first.\n\n4. Set the IN GAME FPS limit to 40. Do not use the Steam side-panel FPS restriction option \n\nPower off deck fully. Hold volume up button and tap power button. When you see the logo appear on the screen, release the volume up button.\n\nBottom right of screen, click that option.\n\nIn the menu, Advanced --> whatever option (VMU? CMU?) is defaulted to 1GB and only has four options (512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB), set that to 2GB.\n\nSave and exit. Wait ~30 seconds for Deck to reboot (screen will be black for a bit). \n\nHelldivers feels WAY more smooth and frame pacing is no longer all over the place.\n\nI've only run difficulties one through five after this tweak, but it's solidly consistent in the 32-40 FPS range, while not looking like complete shit. I categorize this as \"very playable.\"\n\nHope this helps fellow Deck Divers\n\n------------\n\nYou do **not** need to edit config files, use FSR, change from the native resolution of 1280x800, or any of the other in-depth changes you'll see in other posts when googling this issue.\n\nUse the Steam Deck graphics preset and bump up the VRAM allocation and boom you have a playable game",

Recently a thumbstick started to fail, so I changed them both, I assumed the problem would go away after that but it did not, so I think it is safe to assume it is not a hardware related issue.  \n\nGoogled a bunch but cannot find anyone complaining about a similar behavior.

I tried splitting my WiFi to 2.4 and 5 GHz and neither work. I entered desktop mode and fiddled around a bit with the files to enable wpa supplicant instead of iwd, which did nothing as well.

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

    "title": "Another Thread on SD OLED WiFi Issues",
    "selftext": "I have had my Steam Deck OLED for several weeks now, and have made a bunch of changes to it like a 2TB SSD and hall effect sticks and what not. I even built a headless server (Ryzen 7 5800XT, RX 9060 XT 16GB) running Windows 11 specifically for streaming my Windows-only titles (like Battlefield 6) to my Deck. For a while I was just using Steam Remote Play (with all the settings configured according to other threads for the most reliable performance), but frequent gamescope crashes/freezes led me to try Sunshine/Moonlight. Lately I have been using this (along with MoonDeck and MoonDeck Buddy) and have had good results, **when it works**.\n\nFor additional context, I have a pretty high-end home networking setup consisting of all Ubiquiti hardware, and very dense AP coverage (I have a lot of ESP-based IoT devices on a separate SSID). I have a 2.5Gb symmetrical fiber ISP (irrelevant to local streaming but figured I would mention), UCG Fiber gateway/NVR, USW Pro XG 8 PoE 10Gb core switch, USW Flex 2.5g PoE secondary switch, two U7 Pro XGS APs, two U7 In-Wall APs, one U6+ AP and some other PoE switches, etc. etc. The streaming server is on GbE, and I have a highly configured wireless environment with fine-tuned radio transmit power on each AP, minimum RSSI set, etc.\n\nAll that to say, my home network is NOT the issue here, and I have narrowed it down to the WiFi chipset on the Deck being the problem. I have read about these issues and try pretty much every fix there is, but there are just constant issues with the WiFi - dropped packets, disconnects, weird power state issues (even after disabling WiFi power management in the developer settings), and overall just an unplayable streaming experience once the issues start. Sometimes it works without issue, even for several hours, sometimes I cannot even get into a match before it starts stuttering or something crashes. It even frequently causes driver hangs on the host machine because of the connection issues on the Deck.\n\nConversely, using the Moonlight client on my Mac mini (on a 10GbE wired connection), the stream is flawless and rock solid stable even on the longest streaming sessions.\n\nI am wondering if there is any workaround to the frankly unacceptable WiFi issues? Is there a hardware mod to replace the chipset with something better? Third party kernel with different WiFi drivers (or different drivers in general)? Does the SteamOS beta channel have different drivers that solve all these problems? Also, I have tried forcing the WPA supplicant backend, but this just breaks streaming altogether (black screen and choppy audio, Remote Play just flat out refuses to start), so I wasn't able to test stability with the different backend.\n\nI know Valve is 'aware' of the issue, but given that the OLED has been out this long and there still isn't an official fix, I'm at the point of going really far into a rabbit hole to fix it myself. Wondering if anyone in the SD community has come up with a solution.",

Instead of defaulting to Keyboard and Mouse controls, games will keep the Controller UI, and in some cases, will entirely bar me from certain functions (i.e. riding a mount in Palworld) as there is simply no input to do it. This is not a consistent problem, as games like Abiotic Factor are able to be played just fine with keyboard and mouse, but certain games don't have the built-in functions to receive keyboard and mouse inputs instead of Steam Deck inputs. I've looked all over online and have found no real way to fix this, even trying to boot up games with various versions of Proton. I am losing my mind, and am begging for some way to be able to either \"trick\" my games into thinking a computer is running them, or anything else that might work. Thank you. ",

Whenever I try to make it go right, it never slides! Maybe its a design choice, but if it is its not a good one! (In my opinion)\n\nAny ways to fix this?

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

    "selftext": "I normally play on PC (preferred system) but am traveling internationally for the next couple of weeks so have had to resort to Steam Deck. It's an amazing piece of hardware but has always struggled with Helldivers 2.\n\nFinally decided to do some research into actual verified solutions/tweaks that would at least get the game at a locked 40 FPS without hitching/stuttering.\n\nI made four changes:\n\n1. Set graphics preset to the \"Steam Deck ™️\" profile\n\n2. Set Sharpness to .70 (this is personal preference, doesn't affect performance)\n\n3. Boot into the BIOS (don't panic, it's like three clicks in the BIOS GUI), change VRAM pre-allocated amount from the default of 1GB to 2GB. Some posts say do 4GB but I wanted to test results with a slight bump first.\n\n4. Set the IN GAME FPS limit to 40. Do not use the Steam side-panel FPS restriction option \n\nPower off deck fully. Hold volume up button and tap power button. When you see the logo appear on the screen, release the volume up button.\n\nBottom right of screen, click that option.\n\nIn the menu, Advanced --> whatever option (VMU? CMU?) is defaulted to 1GB and only has four options (512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB), set that to 2GB.\n\nSave and exit. Wait ~30 seconds for Deck to reboot (screen will be black for a bit). \n\nHelldivers feels WAY more smooth and frame pacing is no longer all over the place.\n\nI've only run difficulties one through five after this tweak, but it's solidly consistent in the 32-40 FPS range, while not looking like complete shit. I categorize this as \"very playable.\"\n\nHope this helps fellow Deck Divers\n\n------------\n\nYou do **not** need to edit config files, use FSR, change from the native resolution of 1280x800, or any of the other in-depth changes you'll see in other posts when googling this issue.\n\nUse the Steam Deck graphics preset and bump up the VRAM allocation and boom you have a playable game",

    "selftext": "Usually, when I think of a 4X game, I imagine a big screen with Steam opened, keyboard & mouse, and a comfy gamer seat (or back pain if you play for too long!).\n\nBut we’re currently working on ***A Planet of Mine: MasterMine Edition***, a 4X that is cute, cozy, AND designed for handheld console.\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3391740/A\\_Planet\\_of\\_Mine\\_MasterMine\\_Edition/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3391740/A_Planet_of_Mine_MasterMine_Edition/)\n\nReleasing our demo at Steam Next Fest (the demo is still available) allowed us to understand that our game is more Steamdeck than PC oriented. A lot of PC players are used to play without a gamepad and we didn’t fully realize that.\n\nWe’re currently working on keyboard & mouse controls, and it works fine. So you can still play our upcoming game on PC, but it would feel way better on Steamdeck:\n\n* Controls are tailored to play smoothly on a pad and to make full use of all the Steamdeck buttons,\n* UI is designed to be readable on a small screen,\n* There’s a quick game mode, you decide how long you want it to be,\n* If you feel peaceful, you can be friends with other factions,\n* You can do some actions, then pause the game and continue later,\n* Characters are so cute that you want to keep them in your pocket 💙\n\nThe game is perfect to be played on-the-go.  \nWe hope Steamdeck users will enjoy our alien game 😅\n\nNB: Sorry the poor video and sound quality!",

    "selftext": "Hello! I understand this is a very, VERY niche situation, but I believe it would be important to share, since there's very few articles about this out there.\n\nSo, I'm making this post as a warning and a guide for how to recover from a \"bricked\" system, after enrolling keys and enabling secure boot through sbctl in Arch Linux ( this locks you out of SteamOS, and any other OSes not signed by your secure boot keys :) )\n\nI just went through a roller coaster of emotions because I hadn't done enough research, went fiddling around with the system, and found out way too late that there's no way to disable secure boot in the SD's BIOS.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, here are the steps to remove the enrolled keys from the system, even if you didn't sign any files before rebooting (don't ask how I managed that):\n\n\nYou will need the following packages:\n\n- sbctl\n\n- efitools\n\n- mokutil\n\n\nIf no system files were signed:\n\n- Take the drive with your OS, and mount it to another computer;\n\n- Disable secure boot in the second device, and boot;\n\n- Sign the necessary files (using \"sudo sbctl verify\", then \"sudo sbctl sign -s <file>\").\n\n\nIf system files are signed:\n\n- Boot into your OS on your Steam Deck;\n\n- Find the \"PK.key\", \"KEK.key\" and \"db.key\" files that were created with \"sbctl create-keys\" (I used the command: sudo find / -type f -name \"*.key\");\n\n- Use the commands \"mokutil --pk\", \"mokutil --kek\" and \"mokutil --db\" to see the keys that are still enrolled into the system;\n\n- And the following commands to delete each key, one by one (you might have to run some of these multiple times, to account for the multiple keys):\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/PK.key PK\",\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/KEK.key KEK\", and\n    \"sudo efi-updatevar -d 0 -k <path-to-key>/db.key db\"\n\nAfter there are no more keys showing up when the mokutil commands are ran, you should be able to use \"sbctl status\", and see that there are no \"vendor keys\"; Now you can reboot your system, and secure boot should be disabled! Yay!\n\nI combined these steps from these two great guides, thank you very much to the authors:\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Assisted_process_with_sbctl\n\nhttps://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SecureBootForSteamDeck",

    "title": "An idea for a smart home tool — sense check?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m setting up automation in my new apartment (about 65 sqm) and would love some advice on where to start.\n\nMy plan is quite simple — I’d like to have:\n- A couple of smart socket relays\n- A few motion/presence sensors\n- Automated curtains (I’ll use Somfy for that)\n\nI don’t want anything too complex like Home Assistant, since I won’t have too many scenes or devices. Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

    "selftext": "I'm buying a two-family house (in the US) that I will live in one unit for the warmer months, and leave for the winter. The other unit will be occupied full time. I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

    "selftext": "I am reverse engineering local control of a LEDVANCE Tuya Wi-Fi lamp. Color control is on DPS 101 using a binary HSV frame:  \n`00 01 00 04 [apply] [H][H] [S][S] [V][V] [optional suffix]`  \nH is 0–360, S and V are 0–1000 (big-endian). With no suffix the frame sets the whole lamp. With a two-byte suffix it targets a subset. Suffix `81 01…81 04` changes four zones reliably on this device. I also see per-LED addressing using a different suffix: either `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`. In my tests “index” is the zero-based LED position inside the device’s internal pixel map, not a zone number. Example that works: base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==` → hex `00 01 00 04 01 00 D2 03 E8 03 E0 83 11` which sets H=210, S=1000, V=992 on LED index 0x11 (17).\n\nProblem: a small set of LED indices consistently fail on this lamp. Indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, and 22 cause a reboot or produce corrupted color, while neighboring indices succeed under the same timing and brightness. This looks like internal segment or driver boundary addresses that are not writable via the same suffix, but I cannot confirm. I also captured a different binary format starting with `00 C0 01 …` which appears to be a scene/effect DP, possibly intended for multi-segment updates.\n\nWhat I need:\n\n1. The exact meaning of selector suffix bytes (`81`, `82`, `83`) on DPS 101 and which should be used for per-LED addressing versus zone addressing.\n2. Valid index range and any reserved or non-addressable indices for LEDVANCE RGBIC devices (which would explain the failing indices 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22).\n3. Semantics of the “apply” byte in `00 01 00 04` frames beyond `0x01`. Do `0x02` or higher act as queue/commit markers on any firmware?\n4. Whether LEDVANCE exposes a separate scene/effect datapoint for multi-LED writes (I have seen frames starting `00 C0 01 …`). If so, the field layout.\n\nReproduction details:  \n• Transport: TuyAPI local, version 3.3  \n• Prereq: set DPS 20=true (power) and DPS 21=\"colour\"  \n• Working zone writes: `… 81 01` to `… 81 04`  \n• Working per-LED writes: many indices succeed with `83 <index>` or `81 00 <index>`  \n• Failing indices on this unit: 6, 8, 12, 18, 19, 22 (repeatable)  \n• Example working per-LED frame (index 17): base64 `AAEABAEA0gPoA+CDEQ==`\n\nAny confirmed maps, packet captures, or firmware notes for LEDVANCE/Tuya RGBIC addressing would help. I will post a summary of verified suffix semantics and index boundaries once resolved.",

    "selftext": "I've recently started the automation journey, and really trying to be creative on how I set things up.  I'm having problems determining the best way to have the bathroom and hallway work the way I want.    \n\n\nI have:  \nhallway:  switch and ceiling light fixture\n\nbathroom:  fixture (above mirror) with 3 bulbs connected to a switch.  (and vent fan on a switch, but that's another conversation)\n\n  \n I'll be replacing the fixture in the hallway, but not the bathroom.  Ideally, I was thinking a similar lighting setup for both the hall and bathroom.  A presence sensor to operate the lights in each spot.  If it's daytime, then the lights come on daylight white.  If it's night, then the lights come on red, enough to see but not to blind someone in the middle of the night.  In the current switch location would be a dimmer:  pressing \"on\" would switch the lights to white (essentially to override the dimmer, more eye-friendly red if needed).  Dimmer would work as normal, and off would work as normal turning the lights off.  \n\n  \nThe logic seems fairly simple, but I haven't been able to figure out how to set this up.  Most switches don't specify if they can be decoupled, so I'd be taking a guess.  Should I go with the Phillips Hue ecosystem and build out lighting from there?  Or can I do this with different manufacturers in a better way?  Currently I'm centered around SmartLife and Alexa, and am just starting to play with Home Assistant.  ",

I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase?

My idea is to record their readings (probably through video or photos) and then convert those readings into a time-based dataset - basically something like this:\n\nTime         | P1 (bar) | P2 (bar) | P3 (bar) | P4 (bar)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n09:45:30     | 25.07    | 30.90    | 30.80    | 32.60\n09:45:32     | 25.08    | 30.91    | 30.81    | 32.61\n\nHas anyone tried doing something like this before?\n\nIf you know what software, Python libraries, or mobile apps can extract numbers from a video or automate this process - or if there's a simpler cloud-based or no-code solution - I'd really appreciate your suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I noticed someone posted something like \"Z-Wave is dead\", and the comments section was chaos. I got curious enough to test it myself.\n\nWhat I did: I’ve been running both a Z-Wave LR lock and a Thread/Matter lock on two exterior doors for about 3 months now... same model door, same batteries, same automations in HA.\n\nHere is my setup:\n\nHA on a NUC\n\nZ-Wave JS + an Apple TV (Thread border router)\n\nBoth locks set to auto-lock on leave and send “jammed” alerts\n\nHere’s what I found in real use:\n\nLatency:\n\nZ-Wave averages \\~350-400 ms for state updates. Thread is faster (\\~250 ms) when it’s happy, but it jumps all over the place when the mesh hiccups. If the Apple TV reboots, it can take half a minute for the Thread lock to show back up.\n\n(Measured using a simple HA automation that logged state\\_changed timestamps for lock entities to InfluxDB, then charted in Grafana).\n\nBattery:\n\nZ-Wave LR is still at 80%± after 90 days. The Thread one’s down to about 60 %. I’m guessing all the IP chatter burns a bit more juice.\n\n(Both locks used fresh Energizer lithium AAs from day one. Voltage was sampled weekly using a USB multimeter probe connected to the lock’s spare test pads (through a dummy adapter I made)..\n\nRange:\n\nZ-Wave goes through 2 brick walls without a repeater. Thread needed a second router or it would drop randomly.\n\n(Verified with a Z-Wave Zniffer dongle and HA’s network-map plugin.)\n\nIntegration: Both show up fine in HA.\n\nLastly, Reliability:\n\nI even killed HA’s core container mid-automation to test it. The Z-Wave direct association still fired the auto-lock within a second, proving the rule ran locally on the device instead of depending on HA’s event loop. That one test basically sold me.\n\nHonestly, I expected Thread to crush it, newer tech, more buzz, right?\n\nBut after living with both, the “old” one feels way more predictable, especially for stuff that literally keeps the door shut.\n\nRight, this is just my own small test, so take it as anecdotal (but it’s been a fun experiment, and I figured others here might find it useful).\n\nEdit: Appreciate all the feedback! A bunch of you mentioned trying the newer Z-Wave LR hardware, so I picked up one of the fingerprint-enabled models to test. U-Bolt is my choice.\n\n Install was painless, popped right into HA with Z-Wave JS, no hub weirdness.\n\n I’ve tried plenty of Wi-Fi locks over the years, but this one finally feels like the right mix of DIY-friendly and “set it and forget it.” Will report back in a month once it’s had more runtime.",

    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nLong time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

Ideally, I’d like to avoid having several different hubs.\n\nI noticed that the new Echo Dot Max has a built-in smart hub supporting Zigbee, Matter, and Thread Border Router.\nIf I understand correctly, does this mean I wouldn’t need any additional hubs, and I could connect different Zigbee or Matter devices directly to Alexa?\n\nIs the Echo Dot Max good choice as smart home hub? Is Alexa a good choice for simple automation setups?\n\nWhich protocol would you recommend — Matter, Zigbee?\n\nAny recommendations for socket relays and motion/presence sensors that work well with Alexa?\n\nThanks in advance for any tips or personal experiences!",

But I'm also going through a lot of big life changes right now that having a little help from an at home assistant type device would be super helpful where I can just tell it a thing and it will remind me or add it to other devices and stuff like that. I'm also getting some home security stuff (free through my internet provider), but being able to connect all that stuff together or having all the devices stuff connected to my phone & the Alexa would be so helpful and maybe help me understand some of it a bit better. I know you talk to the Alexa, but how else does it work? Like does it set up to your phone too? This is actually the padt where I need the please explain like I'm  5.  I've really only evwr seen people talk to it to do things but idk how else it does what its supposed to do, like the grocery lists or anything else. I just don't  know. Is there a better one to get for certain things like if it would connect to my security system? I don't even know where to start when buying one either, there's so many different kinds, what one should I even get? Or what other connected things should I consider like the special lightbulbs? ",

I can get them to all come back if I powercycle all of my Echos at the same time, but they start dropping off again within an hour.\n\nI'm at a dead-end as far as troubleshooting.  I have tried powercycling, reconfiguring, connecting things in a different order, etc.  I have factory reset everything in the entire system multiple times.  As I previously mentioned, all firmware is up to date.  If it helps, I do have a working HomeAssistant device that I can use for troubleshooting, but for some reason, I can't get it to join the existing Thread network (it always wants to create its own).\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'd like to be able to monitor the property remotely, and my unit especially.\n\nI have a background in IT/tech, and would like to go with a PoE camera system. I'll be running cat6/cat6a myself into a small rack in my unit with a patch panel, router, switch, etc.\n\nThe only experience I've had with cameras/etc is with Wyze cameras and Simplisafe alarm system. I like Wyze, but I'd like something a bit more robust/reliable and with better picture quality. Plus I don't really want to run USB cables everywhere!\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n* Cameras:\n   * PoE. Supporting wifi cameras would also be nice (throw a few solar-powered ones outside on trees/etc) but not a hard requirement. I could just grab a couple cheapo Wyze to monitor what is, essentially, the woods\n   * Indoor and outdoor cameras with minimum 4k resolution. I'm OK with lower resolution inside\n   * Doorbell - 2k is fine, but 4k would be nice. I'd prefer a PoE doorbell I think for reliability's sake\n   * Mostly static cameras, maybe one or two PTZ\n* Security:\n   * Door/window entry sensors (wireless)\n   * Multiple keypads (wireless)\n   * Motion detector (wireless)\n   * Glass break sensors (wireless)\n   * Deadbolt locks:\n      * Must support PIN code\n      * Must have ability to add / remove \"guest\" PINs remotely via app\n      * Must have physical key option\n      * Nice to have external power option (USBC, 9v battery) but not required \n      * Nice to have NFC support, but not required\n* HVAC:\n   * Thermostat that can be controlled remotely\n   * Bonus points if I can set up geofencing/rules to kick it on and off\n* Misc\n   * Controllable outlets would be nice\n\n  \nI'm leaning towards:\n\n**Cameras - Reolink**\n\n* Pros:\n   * PoE with NVR\n   * Many models that look decent\n   * Decently priced\n* Cons:\n   * From what I can find, the doorbell does not support a video call for Android phones. This is almost a dealbreaker for me, but not quite. Apparently it's \"coming soon\" but like shit -- how is this NOT a thing?!\n\n**Security - Simplisafe**\n\n* Pros:\n   * I know it, it works\n   * Offers monitoring with emergency service dispatch\n   * I like the keyfob 🤷\n* Cons:\n   * In my experience, the system / app can be a bit slow\n\n**Door Lock - Simplisafe?**\n\n   * I feel like it makes the most sense to use a Simplisafe lock, but it does't have a physical key which I, as someone who feels the need to have a \"backup plan\" for things, kind of have as a hard requirement\n   * I'm open to any lock, as long as it does what I need it to do (listed above)\n\n**HVAC - Ecobee**\n\n* It came highly recommended by a friend. I've never had anything other than a $20 \"digital\" thermostat (or mercury dial ones) so I'm kind of in the dark here\n\n**Automation / Alerting**  \n  \nSomething I don't quite understand is the whole tech/ecosystem thing when it comes to automating stuff. Zigbee? Zwave? Matter? Google Home? Home Assistant? WTF are all of these, what is the best for my purpose? Can I make these systems work in harmony somehow?\n\nProbably helps to mention that I'm all Android -- no iPhone. I know a lot of things mention \"Home Assistant\" which from what I can tell is an Apple thing, which is of zero value to me. I'd like to be able to set up some conditional rules like \"when I'm within 5 miles of home turn on the heat/AC\" or \"Send me an email if door code 12345 (or whatever) is used\". Nothing fancy.\n\nThanks in advance for any help! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI would like to present my project called TOMMY, which turns ESP32 devices into motion sensors that work through walls and obstacles using Wi-Fi sensing.\n\nTOMMY started as a project for my own use. I was frustrated with motion sensors that didn't detect stationary presence and left dead zones everywhere. Presence sensors existed but were expensive and needed one per room. I explored echo localization first, but microphones listening 24/7 felt too creepy. Then I discovered Wi-Fi sensing - a huge research topic but nothing production-ready yet. It ticked all the boxes: could theoretically detect stationary presence through breathing/micromovements and worked through walls and furniture so devices could be hidden away.\n\nTwo years and dozens of research papers later, TOMMY has evolved into software I'm honestly quite proud of. Although it doesn't have stationary presence detection yet (coming Q1 2026) it detects motion really well. It works as a Home Assistant Add-on or Docker container, supports Matter and works with a range of ESP32 devices which can be flashed through the built-in tool or used alongside existing ESPHome setups.\n\nI released the first version a couple of months ago and got a lot of interest and positive feedback. More than 200 people joined the Discord community and almost 2,000 downloaded it.\n\nRight now TOMMY is in beta, which is completely free for everyone to use. I'm also offering free lifetime licenses to every beta user who joins the Discord channel.\n\nYou can read more about the project on https://www.tommysense.com. Please join the Discord channel if you are interested in the project.\n\nA note on open source: There's been a lot of interest in having TOMMY as an open source project, which I fully understand. I'm reluctant to open source before reaching sustainability, as I'd love to work on this full time. However, privacy is verifiable - it's 100% local with no data collection (easily confirmed via packet sniffing or network isolation). Happy to help anyone verify this.",

Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. \n\n  \nSimple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. \n\nAlmost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. \n\nI have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, we are working on something and I'd like to know your honest opinion, sort of a sense-check.\n\nIt's a tool (or rather a suite of tools) that guides you step by step through the process of building and maintaining a smart home. A sort of co-pilot for integrators or powerusers of Home Assistant / KNX / Loxone / Crestron... \n\nThe aim is to speed up planning, documentation, troubleshooting.. You describe what you want your home to do, the AI agent helps translate that into functional logic, suggests device placement on a floor plan and can  generate plans for other trades (lighting, HVAC, etc.) according to building norms. Or if you have an existing smart home, it can analyze logs, back up configurations, and help you debug issues by simply asking in natural language.\n\nWe’re still in development and not selling anything yet — just trying to see if there’s real value in this idea. Here's a bit more info about it, if you're interested: [https://www.smarthomesuite.app/](http://smarthomesuite.app/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=thread&utm_campaign=HomeAutomation_Reddit)\n\nAny feedback welcome!

    "selftext": "**Background**: Complete Newbie and enthusiast here, trying to get started with some projects at home. I know very little about automation or the physics behind much of it. But I am more than willing to put in the effort to learn it. \n\n**Context**: I need to install motorized curtains. This is going to be my first home automation project. I have low-voltage power cables hanging out at the top corners of the windows. The other end of the cables are in the networking box, waiting to be connected to a power panel. \n\n**Problem**:    \n1. I am not sure what to look for in a curtain motor that would work with the cables I am having (HP-16/2OFC-PUR). Lutron, Somfy, and Smartwings are either very expensive or don't work for my situation. I am running into issues buying the Lutron or Somfy motors since they only sell them through dealers, and none of the dealers I spoke to would just sell the motors. The only one selling them to me (along with the tracks) is very expensive.   \n  \n**Ask**:  \nAny inexpensive recommendations for curtain motors? Can I modify popular motors to work on DC power instead of AC? What should I look for in a curtain motor, and how do I connect the cable to the motor? Since I have 16/2 passive power cables, I am assuming I would have to rely on the Motor's inbuilt capabilities to connect to a smart hub for automation.   \n  \nAny recommendations for a network/power panel that will support a large number of connections?   \nI will be connecting \\~10 cables for Curtain motors, around \\~12 other cables for cameras and security devices. etc and later upgrade to add \\~10 CAT6 ethernet cables for LAN\n\nAppreciate any recommendations for good resources to train myself in these matters. Happy to compensate you a bit for your time, if you are willing to educate me.    \n  \nAny help is greatly appreciated.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37r0zva0oaxf1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=864d4cdaae06bd2ebec34beb3f7f53977dda61b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a5hfchu3paxf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7784d3a5a075ce55389f95ede5937e75fdbcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5h1vl68qaxf1.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bb6b96e53ea05b3f45c2b6ea705de2730d4daf\n\n",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks — here’s what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

I have 2 questions that I would really appreciate your help with:\n\nFirst, do you have any recommendations for a smart door lock? I have done a lot of research and narrowed down to a few options: (a) Aqara U100, (b) Schlage Encode Plus, or (c) Schlage Arrive. I really like how optimized the experience feels with Aqara, and their locks look sleek. However, I did note that their locks themselves were not ANSI Grade 1 locks like the Schlage locks are, and in addition, I did see a few user comments regarding defects and bugs with Aqara products.\n\nMy second question is regarding how these smart devices connect in your home. I saw that Aqora has a hub, but Schlage does not seem to have a hub. If I purchase a specific brand's door lock, am I then locked into that ecosystem unless I purchase individual hubs for each new brand I purchase? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm brand new to home automation haha\n\nI appreciate all your help and look forward to hearing your advice!",

I've bought most of them second hand, and they're all either 3rd or 4th generation. \n\nAs speakers I think they sound good, or certainly good enough for my casual listening while walking around the house.\n\nThe problem is the integration with Spotify over the years feels like it's really degraded. I don't know whose \"fault\" this is, e.g. I can see something like, I don't know, \"Amazon changed their API and exposes speaker groups it has automatically created from rooms as well, and tag them with some new property so the third party knows to filter them out if they want\", or \"the API Spotify is using to list speaker groups actually returns all versions of a speaker group, Spotify should be excluding non-active speaker groups\" - or maybe it's an issue with Amazon.\n\nAnyway, it's annoying. It's _rare_ these days that when I want to play a song on my \"everywhere\" speaker group it \"just works\" - and as Implied there are a lot of speaker groups that I never created myself and don't want (I suspect these are automatically generated by Amazon).\n\nI'm mainly shouting into the void here I know. I don't really have the appetite at the moment to spend thousands to switch to Sonos, and I don't really know what a good alternative is. Realistically I'll keep dealing with this for a lot longer because like I said generally I like the speaker quality and it's the system I have. It's just pretty annoying.\n\nThanks for listening :)",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI'm building a smart setup for my bedroom and here’s what I’ve picked so far:\n\n* Xiaomi Smart Ceiling Light D30\n* Aqara Smart Wall Switch H1 (No Neutral)\n* Aqara Hub E1\n\nEverything will be controlled through Mi Home, and/ or Apple Home as well.\n\nMy goal is to have full app control and some simple automations like:\n\n* after 8 PM, set a warmer light temperature;\n* in the morning, switch back to cool white;\n* maybe trigger different brightness levels via the wall switch.\n\nI’d really appreciate recommendations based on actual experience and quality:\n\n* is the Xiaomi D30 a good choice or should I look for a brighter/RGB model?\n* is there a better-performing or faster wall switch?\n* I’d also like a smart outlet that’s flat and matches the H1 design, ideally with a USB port. Any suggestions?\n\nI’ve read quite a few reviews saying Aqara can be hit-or-miss in smart setups (lag, stability, hub quirks). I’m open to solid alternatives available in Europe (EU versions). Please share your picks.  \n  \nLooking for a reliable setup with low latency and stable performance over time.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "I have a large system that is a collection random smarthome products. I have some things controlled by a Smartthings v2 hub, some by Amazon Echo and some by various manufactures apps. Total off about 70 devices all running on my Xfinity 1.5g router connection, some parts of the system are 10 years old. System has worked flawlessly for all that time. System has window/door sensors, motion detectors, smoke/CO2 alarms, garage door controller, thermostat and a few other devices.\n\nA few weeks ago a problem has come up - 7 or 8 items will turn on and off a random times. These are all lights, some smart bulbs, some hard wired dimmers and some smart plugs plugged into various outlets around the house. The same collection of lights are the only thing I'm aware of having the issue They are a mix of Z-Wave, Zigbee and cloud based formats. I'm at a loss trying to find what is triggering these items. I've done a Z-wave repair, changed Zigbee channels then pulled the Smartthings hub out of the system, removing it stopped a few of the lights from cycling but not all. I've told Alexa to disable hunches, no luck, I have a couple of google home controllers but I don't think they do hunches.\n\nI'm at a loss on how to track down the issue. It's not feasible to disable everything and slowly add them back in, plus it could be another electronic item triggering this, but I have not added any new equipment recently.",

I currently have it on a smart outlet thats on/off on a schedule. I would like to find a smart outlet that will dim on/off the lights over the course of anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes. I dont really care what the time increment is. I just wanna be able to set it to dim on at x time and dim off at x time. I have cruised youtube and the google and have not found what I'm lookin for yet, i dont think. So i figured id come to the ole reddit and see if what I'm looking for even exists and if anyone has specific products they would suggest. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all, thank you in advance for any insight you can provide.\n\n**Prior to our issues:** we have a Google Home and multiple brands/types of smart devices. All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

Sure enough, I was prompted to login and it logged in successfully this time, and my device was listed. Hit the power button via the app and sure enough it went off.\n\nWent into SmartThings linked services and reconnected it successfully to the Sengled cloud. Device is now controllable again in Smartthings.\n\nI know most (if not all) people that have Sengled devices have moved on to non-cloud dependent devices, but figured anyone that still has a Sengled device and has been using the manual control button since their cloud service went offline, might want to know that it's back up again. Guess we'll see how long it lasts this time.\n\n  \nEdit: 10/20/2025 was when traffic started logging in my firewall again for the Sengled device.",

Power will come from a normal wall socket.\n\nAfter some research, the **Philips Hue LightStrip Plus** seems like a convenient option (wake-up feature built into the Hue app, no complex setup required).  \nBut I’ve read that the brightness drops quite a bit with longer runs, so I’m wondering if there’s a better alternative.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* As white as possible (for sunlight simulation)\n* High brightness (lots of lumens)\n* Dense LEDs per meter for a smooth light line\n* Ideally works with Home Assistant, HomeKit, or a similar platform\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Anyone here using Hue LightStrips on 4–5 meters? Is the brightness still good?\n* Any better alternatives with higher output or more flexibility? (Zigbee, Wi-Fi, ESP32, etc.)\n* Bonus points if you’ve done something similar and can share photos or setup details.\n\nFor context: I have a **Proxmox server** running at home, so hosting extra software (like Home Assistant or Node-RED) isn’t a problem if needed.\n\nThanks in advance — and if you’ve built something like this, I’d love to see your setup!",

Do I need to replace both thermostats with smart ones, or can I get away with just one and use smart TRVs upstairs?\n2. Can I avoid heating the unused spare bedroom, or does the thermostat being in there limit that?\n3. What smart heating system would you recommend for this setup? I know about Hive, Tado, Nest, and Bosch EasyControl, but open to others.\n4. Are smart TRVs worth it, and which brands work best with my boiler?\n5. Any tips for staging the upgrade (e.g. thermostat first, then TRVs)?\n6. Anything I should watch out for with multi-zone setups or compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights!",

All are mostly related to lighting. These included smart bulbs and smart sockets. We had everything set up working well and voice commands to the google home worked no problem to get things going. Everything is connected to Wi-Fi because we are too tech-illiterate to set up Zigbee or a similar network. \n\n**Now:** we had to get a new xfinity plan because our previous one was getting too expensive. We changed our modem/router (Xfinity Gateway), but kept the wifi name/password the same. The majority of our smart devices are no longer connecting. I will list them below:\n\n**1) Sengled:** we have two Sengled Smartbulbs, both say offline and, after looking through posts on this sub, it seems the app is not working so we are figuring this is a bust and we will have to get new smartbulbs if we want to continue using voice commands with those light. **Has anyone had success getting Sengled bulbs to connect again?**\n\n**2) Teckin:** we have 4 Teckin smart sockets that are not able to connect to the Teckin app. 3 are brand new and one that were previously connected to light sources in our house. One of the old Teckin smart sockets was able to be reconnected through the SmartLife app. We have 3 Teckin smart sockets that were already connected to the network and are still working properly even after changing the Xfinity Gateway. They did not need to be reconnected, they did so automatically. **Does anyone have any recommendations on how to connect the sockets that are no longer working?**",

Now, Google wants nearly £300 for renewal  and it’s being rebranded as Google Home Premium Advanced.\n\nThat price jump feels insane for what I’m getting.\n\nI’ve recently moved all my automations to Home Assistant and absolutely love it. It’s made me realize how much control I could have outside Google’s ecosystem.\n\nSo, my question:\nWhat’s the best way to move away from Google/Nest entirely while keeping similar functionality (especially for cameras and hubs)?\n\nIs there a good local/NAS-based alternative for video storage and smart home integration?\n\nAnyone here migrated from Nest to Home Assistant-compatible cameras successfully?\n\nAnd what’s the best use for the Nest Hubs if I start de-Googling everything?\n\n\nAppreciate any tips or migration stories from folks who’ve done this , I’m happy to tinker, but I don’t want to lose reliability or ease of use for the family.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "title": "Mysterious Beeping Sound, Unable to find source after tracking 20+ timestamps. What device could this be?",
    "selftext": "Hello! Our house which we moved into a few months ago has a strange beeping sound. It seems to be 4-5 notes, and based on the spectrogram, a single tone each time in the following order: 2kHz, 3kHz, 4kHz, 6kHz, 8kHz.\n\nIt is unpredictable and maybe beeps 1-3 times per day, sometimes multiple times in a row. Because of this, we are skeptical to think it is a low battery indicator. The sound is muffled sometimes, clear other times. We've only heard it in our living room and office, once in the bedroom.\n\nAll CO/Smoke detectors have been checked (and none are as pleasant a sound as this). Admittedly we do have a lot of smart home devices (light bulbs, Alexas, smart switches, and Deco mesh network). Another suspicion is our neighbor's security cameras that are outdoors (explains why it might be muffled), but they appear to be hardwired.\n\nBecause of the infrequency of the sound, this is the best recording we have, so sorry for the low quality. We are trying to triangulate the sound with little success.\n\nI am hoping someone may recognize this sound, or, can suggest other potential culprits. Thank you in advance!\n\nSincerely, a couple of unemployed homebodies who are going a little crazy.",

    "title": "Been testing Bringnox smart shades with HomeKit for 3 weeks — here’s what I learned",
    "selftext": "So I finally joined the smart shades club. I’ve been slowly adding more stuff to my HomeKit setup (lights, sensors, plugs), and the last missing piece was window shades.\nAfter reading way too many posts and reviews, I decided to try Bringnox — mostly because it supports Matter and doesn’t need a separate hub.\n\nHere’s my honest take after 3 weeks:\n\nSetup\nPairing was honestly smoother than I expected. I just scanned the Matter code in the Home app, and it popped right up. Took maybe 30 seconds.\nOne thing: it didn’t connect the first time because my Wi-Fi was on the 5GHz band, so I had to switch my phone to 2.4GHz — after that, no issues.\n\nDaily use\nI set them to open at sunrise and close at sunset using automations. It’s surprisingly consistent — every morning when I’m still half asleep, the shades go up and sunlight fills the room. Feels kinda luxurious tbh.\nI also made a “Movie mode” scene that closes all the shades + dims the lights. Works every time.\n\nBattery\nStill on the first charge. I use them twice a day, and they’re showing around 85%. I’ll update if that changes, but it looks like they’ll easily last months between charges.\n\nNoise & Speed\nThey move quietly — not dead silent, but a soft hum. Way quieter than the old Tuya-based blinds I had before.\nSpeed is good too. Full open/close in maybe 20 seconds?\n\nHomeKit stability\nThis part really surprised me. Even when my Wi-Fi dropped once, I could still control them because Matter allows local control. My other non-Matter devices all went “no response” 😅.\nAnd when Amazon services went down a few days ago (apparently a big AWS issue), Alexa and some smart plugs stopped responding — but my Bringnox shades still worked perfectly through HomeKit.\nIt’s not something you think about until it happens, but having local control is so nice.\n\nLooks & feel\nI got the light-filtering fabric. It feels way higher quality than expected — thick, smooth, and the stitching looks clean. I ordered them in a light gray color that blends well with my walls.\n\nDownsides\n\nThe app itself (Tuya-based) isn’t super polished, but since I mostly use HomeKit, that doesn’t bother me.\n\nDelivery took about 2 weeks (custom size), but that’s fair.\n\nFinal thoughts\nNot sponsored or anything — I just really like when something actually works with HomeKit and doesn’t drop connection every other day.\nIf you’re building a Matter setup and want shades that look decent, Bringnox has been great so far. I’ll see how the battery holds up over winter and update later.",

I don’t need full remote control, just a simple solution that can handle this small motion—so I can avoid having to do it manually each time.\n\nHas anybody tried something similar or have any tips or suggestions for a device or hack I could use?

I even tried installing an older GPU and got the same problem, I then replaced the motherboard with an identical one thinking it was a faulty mobo, same thing, got to use it once for a few hours, shut down to go to sleep, next day, turns on, lights on, GPU not responding.

The physical windows key on my keyboard also doesn't work anymore.  \nAnd like... when I click it, it does the animation of being clicked, but nothing actually happens and the bracket doesn't open. The only way I can make it work is by going on the task manager and resetting file explorer, then it works just fine. But I have to do it every single time I turn on my PC and it's getting annoying.\n\nDoes anyone know about this problem and how to fix it?\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi, I get confused between HDD and SSD or SMR and various brands. I had bad experience with Seagate and usually buy WD My Book but it's expensive.\n\n\n\nMy logic has been to buy multiple drives because if a huge drive like 22 TB fails then it's over and I spent a lot of money on it. But at the same time, can't have a room full of like 4 TB drives, they take up space. So I go with somewhere in the middle like 12 TB drives.\n\n\n\nAbout three fourth of my drive remain untouched and the rest is moved to different folders or deleted or edited. I use my drives for home videos, pics from my phone, ebooks and shows I downloaded, music, occasional games or software.\n\n\n\nI have a few hundred dollars set aside and given my very limited budget (this is it for like a year), I want to make the best of things. How should I approach this? What brands and what models and what types of drive? One SSD then a cheap HDD? Two HDDs? A WD My Book and some cheaper Seagate? it's so confusing.",

    "selftext": "Hiya,\n\nWe won [this PC](https://shop.mining-base.co.jp/products/palworld-collaboration-pc-middle?srsltid=AfmBOopwhjJ8rBVGvbhVIOIDihGvU-in6agViWIkpjWOt5LEh7j-UHeS) in a giveaway from Japan, and are now setting it up. It didn't come with setup instructions, but the hardware generally seemed consistent with what we've had previously.\n\nWe've connected everything, including initially just the DisplayPort cable but now both that and an HDMI cable. The end of the power cable that plugs into the wall has a yellow and green wire, I believe a grounding lead, attached to it, with a plastic cover over the connector - currently, we just have this floating freely, not touching anything, as my understanding is we don't need this in North America.\n\nOnce everything was connected, we powered it on, and immediately were hit with some questions/concerns:\n\n1) We aren't getting any video output on the monitor regardless of input (DisplayPort or the 2 HDMI inputs).\n\n2) Both XPG RAM sticks are glowing red (don't know if this is a problem or functioning as intended).\n\n3) Theres an LED button on the PC that changes the colour of the LED lights. When it's set to white, we notice a slight flickering, and we hear occasional stop-and-go \"slushing\" of liquid. When it's set to other colours, we don't notice flickering, and what we hear varies between a constant gentle \"stream\" sound and more stop-and-go slushing.\n\n4) As I'm writing this, it's been powered on for a little bit, and now we don't hear the liquid. Maybe all of the liquid sounds, both constant and stop-and-go, were just during the initial boot?\n\nThe one issue we are for sure having right now is no video output showing up on our monitor. Everything else is potentially working fine, we just aren't sure due to it being our first liquid-cooled PC.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

Seeing this issue, I stopped doing anything with that phone, until 1 year back, where I took it a local shop and had it's battery replaced. The phone worked decently after that, but couple months later, the phone refused to wake up and constantly entered into bootloop with just the apple logo flashing when plugged in.

I've tried dozens of times to boot it, different options and such, no luck, eventually freezes.  \n\n* \\- I tried booting from a windows flash drive, freezes every time\n* \\- Reset BIOS settings (although no bios change to begin with as cause) and didn't help\n* \\- Replaced motherboard, physically examined parts, everything looks fine to my layman's eyes, no bent pins on CPU or anything, but it didn't help, still froze both with windows boot and with bootable flash drive\n* \\- I asked ChatGPT and then tried to confirm what it was saying via google, but it was just making stuff up.\n* \\- BIOS settings run fine, never an issue, windows will sometimes try to boot up to the point where I can choose a partition or more settings from a menu with a light blue background but always ends up freezing when I progress further.\n* \\- Don't know if this matters but I have two hard drives, I have my primary SSD (which is the older one, about 3-4 years old, the other SSD boots through this one) in the secondary NVME slot because the newer one that I bought takes advantage of the faster primary NVME port.\n\n  \nHere is my build if that helps:\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JCMiller23/saved/#view=nFMcxr](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JCMiller23/saved/#view=nFMcxr)\n\n",

This wasn't anything too strange, I know it's not normal, but it had happened before and usually a reboot fixed the issue. So that's what I did. Unofrtunately this time around the PC took at least 30 secs to a minute to even power down and when it did it made a strange whir sound. I thought it was weird, but didn't pay it too much mind. When I tried to restart it I got hit with an error message from (I think) my motherboard which read: \"Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart it for you Stop code: DRIVER\\_IQRL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL (0xD1). The PC then rebooted. When it did it gave me message saying it would attempt to fix it and then transition between steps, sich as \"Fixing issue\" and \"Establishing internet connection\" this however failed and the same error message as before popped up, except with a little extra text that read \"What failed: mtkwl6ex.sys\" The PC then rebooted again. At this point it then fails to boot by staying in the pre-bios screen (I'm not sure what it's called, but it's just a black screen with a little dash in the top left corner\" It won't move from this menu and the DRAM and CPU lights on my Mainboard are flashing. When I then power it off with the power button this entire process starts from the beginning. I have a Ryzen 7 7600, an Asrock B650M Pro RS and CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM.

    "selftext": "*TL;DR - Gaming PC owned for 9 months, recently started shutting down mid-game, regardless of game, with no audible or visible warnings. Tried a multitude of fixes to no avail. Decided to factory reset and now no issues. What was the likely cause?*\n\nI have had an ASUS ROG G22CH Gaming PC - Intel i7-14700F, RTX 4070 Super, 1 TB SSD for about 9 months. Have had zero problems and it's easily one of the best PCs I've ever owned despite ASUS' infamous reputation with QC. Love the compact form factor, it's quite the 10L powerhouse.\n\nHowever, one time about 1 month ago and again over the last couple days, the PC will shut down, without any warning whatsoever, mid-game after 30min-1hr. It's never consistent. It doesn't matter what the game is, the PC powers off in an instant. I have to unplug and replug back into the socket to turn it back on.\n\nThe last game that was played to completion was Indiana Jones back in February and I did so without any issue. But between now and then, something went wrong somewhere because then any other game I tried to play would crash during the aforementioned playtime.\n\nI tried different sockets, both wall and extensions, different power cable, ran a memory test, updated drivers, monitored CPU/GPU temps, lowered graphics settings, changed NVIDIA/Windows power settings, fiddled in the BIOS with Intel Turbo settings, opened the PC to clean (almost zero dust), etc. etc, any proposed solution I could find or think of. There was absolutely nothing wrong either visibly or audibly that I could see. Fans did not rev up prior to shutdown, no BSOD, no lagging/stuttering in the games, no audio chipping, PC was not excessively hot.\n\nThen today, I factory resetted and have now been playing for well over 2 hours. Literally just got to the home screen after installation, installed the Xbox app, then a random game, and started playing.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what may have caused this? Any Google search and Reddit post I could find pointed to either a faulty PSU or bad RAM sticks which neither seem to be the case now. ",

If I get a network card capable of 2.5gbps (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BG685PKM?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image) one) and a cat 8 ethernet cable would that let me reach the 2.5gbps speed or would the motherboard still act as a bottleneck? Thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nIv just moved into a new home and set up my usually reliable internet. I have connected my router to a tp link powerlink adapter so my Xbox can be hardwired to the adapter/extender. The router is too far away to directly connect to the Xbox via Ethernet. \n\nI get 600+mbps on WiFi near the router. The WiFi signal in my office near my Xbox is ok. When I use the powerlink adapter, my Xbox (via Ethernet to the adapter in the office) gets 30mbps. In my previous homes I never experienced such a severe difference in internet speeds. So perhaps it’s due to the electrical wiring in this house? \n\nMy question here is would it be better for my Xbox internet speeds to buy a traditional WiFi extender, then connect that directly to my Xbox? Or - shall I just connect to existing WiFi? \n\nThanks. ",

    "title": "Suspected GPU error",
    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am here for a last hail mary attempt before buying a new GPU.\n\nOver the last couple of months I have intermittently encountered a weird error on my Windows 11 PC.  \nBasically at random times the screens go black, I hear the sound for devices disconnecting but I can still hear and talk to the people I am in a discord call with. The only way out I have found have been to force shut down the computer and start it back up.\n\nIt has usually happened so far when I am running high demanding games, Mortal Online 2 (insanely bad optimization), Dune Awakening on high settings, and recently Baldur's Gate 3. But also when running Phasmophobia, which I don't believe is too demanding, but maybe it is also badly optimized?\n\nI also play A LOT of Dota 2, but it hasn't happened a single time while playing that game on max setting, although I feel like my computer handles that game with ease.\n\nThe first time it happened was during a heatwave this summer, and I figured it was an issue with overheating, so I installed 6 new fans in the chassis and saw a drop in temperature, although mostly on the CPU, from around 75C on full utilization, to around 65C. But the GPU is stable at around 86-87C, it was 88-89 before, on 100%.\n\nI have turned to ChatGPT to try to find some help. What I have come up with so far is that it's these errors that seem to happen at the time of the black screen:\n\n    VIDEO_TDR_TIMEOUT_DETECTED (117)\n    The display driver failed to respond in timely fashion. (This code can never be used for a real BugCheck; it is used to identify live dumps.\n    Arguments: \n    Arg1: ffff9708e80a4010, Optional pointer to internal TDR recovery context (TDR_RECOVERY_CONTEXT). \n    Arg2: fffff801176276e0, The pointer into responsible device driver module (e.g. owner tag). \n    Arg3: 0000000000000000, The secondary driver specific bucketing key. \n    Arg4: ffff9708dd297080, Optional internal context dependent data.\n\nAnd\n\n    VIDEO_MINIPORT_BLACK_SCREEN_LIVEDUMP (1b8) User initiated miniport black screen live dump. (This code can never be used for a real BugCheck; it is used to identify live dumps.) User initiated miniport live dump for black screen scenarios. \n    Arguments: \n    Arg1: 000000000000000a, Source which triggered the miniport black screen live dump. \n    Arg2: 0000000000000000, Reserved. \n    Arg3: 0000000000000000, Reserved. \n    Arg4: 0000000000000000, Reserved.\n\nAlso around these errors there were reports of errors with SteelSeries and Nahimic and ChatGPT suggested a few steps.  \nDisable all game overlays, Steam, SteelSeries, Nahimic, Discord. All of this I have done.\n\nIt also suggested I install DDU and to a fresh install of my WHQL NVIDIA driver, which I have done.\n\nNow most recently when it happened and I felt like we are getting closer and closer to just getting a new GPU I was suggested to install OCCT and run the VRAM test and 3D Adaptive test, and see if it gets any errors, which would strongly indicate an issue with the actual GPU, I tried to run these for about 20 minutes each, but in both tests it came back with zero errors reported. So now I feel stumped because if it shows no errors, would that indicate that the GPU is okay? I just want to avoid buying a new one and then ending up with the exact same problem.\n\nFew other things of note.  \nI am running three monitors, two via Display Port cables, and one via HDMI with a VGA adapter to the monitor.\n\nI ran a UserBenchMark test on the whole computer, and every measurement point was within green metrics, except my GPU which got a score of 66% Performing below potential (49th percentile). (As the Automod Bot correctly mentioned, UserBenchMark is pretty shitty and shouldn't be used for any objective data, I just thought I would add this to give any possible context to my GPU)\n\nEarlier in spring I got a weird thing where the input for my keyboard died all of a sudden, the lights were still on but it did not respond. Only when I pulled the USB out and put it back in did it wake up. I then had my mouse in the keyboards USB port and figured it was something there, so I input the mouse directly into a USB port on the computer instead and since then nothing like it has happened.\n\nMy computer specs.\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X  \nGPU: Nvidia RTX 3070-Ti  \nSystem drive: Corsair MP600 CORE 1TB  \nExtra drive: Kingston SA400S37960G 960GB  \nRAM: Corsair CMH32GX4M2Z3600C18 2x16GB  \nMotherboard: Asus ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI)  \nPSU: Corsair TX850M\n\nSo, any ideas of next steps to check? If it is likely that the GPU is faulty at this point so be it, I just don't want to get a new one and experience the same issues.\n\n(Also, if the flair is incorrect with Hardware, as this feels like it might be a hardware issue, but also might be a Software issue, let me know and I'll change it)",

I have a lot of programs and data on this machine that I don't want to break (kind of spread across 3 SSDs, though 1 is purely Steam). \n\n  \nMy question is: if I want to have a new boot SSD with clean windows, will this break programs I have installed in the current C drive. If not, can I remove windows from the old SSD to not have a Dual Boot situation, without removing data. If I am able to do the above, will programs on the OLD C drive still be able to be used without re-installing on the new boot drive. \n\n  \nLet me know if I need to clarify, there's no rush for this.

I immediately tried changing the password but the hacker beat me to it and somehow using phone number verification I was able to change my email password, but it was too late, the hacker had already logged on to my discord and started sending scam messages to my friends..  \nI also ended up changing my discord password but I am very paranoid because I use that same password for almost every site and this is my first time being hacked. Im very nervous and scared and hence im not able to keep it short and concise, PLEASE advice me on what to do",

If someone could walk me through some steps here, I'd appreciate it?\n\nRight now, I have tried connecting my phone via 2 separate cords to the desktop, one C to C and one USB-C to USB-A.\n\nWhen I go to enable USB Tethering on my phone, I go to Settings // Connections // Mobile Hotspot and Tethering, and this is where the setting to turn USB Tethering on or off is, but it's greyed out.\n\nI can connect my phone to my computer via hotspot, and very shortly via bluetooth although it doesn't stay connected... I know I am supposed to get a pop-up that lets me decide whether to simply charge or share data? But it doesn't pop up. I am fairly sure all three cords I've tried are name-brand, modern cords... and again, I've tried both C to C & C to A cords...\n\nI just tried to plug my phone into my laptop, which is also Windows 11 using the C to A charger (laptop doesn't have a C port), so I think I can at least rule out it being something solely to do with the desktop's drivers?\n\nBut that means it could be a Windows 11 issue, an issue with this specific cord (highly doubt it), or it has to do with USB Tethering not being enabled on my phone... but again, not sure how to, since it seems to be just straight-up greyed out.\n\nI'd love help to see what could be causing this.

Nothing works so far.  \n\nAny ideas on how to take it back to just the defaily setting would be greatly appreciated.",

It didn't come with setup instructions, but the hardware generally seemed consistent with what we've had previously.\n\nWe've connected everything, including initially just the DisplayPort cable but now both that and an HDMI cable. The end of the power cable that plugs into the wall has a yellow and green wire, I believe a grounding lead, attached to it, with a plastic cover over the connector - currently, we just have this floating freely, not touching anything, as my understanding is we don't need this in North America.\n\nOnce everything was connected, we powered it on, and immediately were hit with some questions/concerns:\n\n1) We aren't getting any video output on the monitor regardless of input (DisplayPort or the 2 HDMI inputs).\n\n2) Both XPG RAM sticks are glowing red (don't know if this is a problem or functioning as intended).\n\n3) Theres an LED button on the PC that changes the colour of the LED lights. When it's set to white, we notice a slight flickering, and we hear occasional stop-and-go \"slushing\" of liquid. When it's set to other colours, we don't notice flickering, and what we hear varies between a constant gentle \"stream\" sound and more stop-and-go slushing.\n\n4) As I'm writing this, it's been powered on for a little bit, and now we don't hear the liquid. Maybe all of the liquid sounds, both constant and stop-and-go, were just during the initial boot?\n\nThe one issue we are for sure having right now is no video output showing up on our monitor. Everything else is potentially working fine, we just aren't sure due to it being our first liquid-cooled PC.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

I've held on to it even after changing iPhones. 2-3 years back, the iPhone had some issue with it's battery where it was loosing battery really quickly. Seeing this issue, I stopped doing anything with that phone, until 1 year back, where I took it a local shop and had it's battery replaced. The phone worked decently after that, but couple months later, the phone refused to wake up and constantly entered into bootloop with just the apple logo flashing when plugged in. Any tips to revive it? I don't have much knowledge about reviving phones, so any detailed tips would be really helpfull!!!",

I could not figure out how to download the drivers properly so I just brought my whole PC over to the ethernet cable for installation. I figured it would be easier to install drivers if I already had windows completely ready. So I finished the installation process and now have windows but no internet connection. I moved my computer back upstairs to where there's no ethernet connection (which was probably a mistake) and now I can't figure out how to install drivers. My motherboard is the Asus PRIME B550M-A WIFI II Am4. I do not currently have any internet connection and I would prefer not having to move my computer again but if that's the only way I guess I'll have to. Can anyone teach me what driver I will need and how to install it?\n\nOh also under settings - Network and internet there is no wifi option at all",

The first screens backlight still works, and windows detects it and even reinstalls drivers. I used DDU 2 times, and reinstalled my AMD drivers, nothing changed. I have a vega 64 GPU, a BenQ GW2270 monitor, and the faulty one being a Crua CR240HDU.

And sometimes when i restart my pc its says no internet connection only local network or something. \n\nPlease help me!",

I've tried dozens of times to boot it, different options and such, no luck, eventually freezes.  \n\n* \\- I tried booting from a windows flash drive, freezes every time\n* \\- Reset BIOS settings (although no bios change to begin with as cause) and didn't help\n* \\- Replaced motherboard, physically examined parts, everything looks fine to my layman's eyes, no bent pins on CPU or anything, but it didn't help, still froze both with windows boot and with bootable flash drive\n* \\- I asked ChatGPT and then tried to confirm what it was saying via google, but it was just making stuff up.\n* \\- BIOS settings run fine, never an issue, windows will sometimes try to boot up to the point where I can choose a partition or more settings from a menu with a light blue background but always ends up freezing when I progress further.\n* \\- Don't know if this matters but I have two hard drives, I have my primary SSD (which is the older one, about 3-4 years old, the other SSD boots through this one) in the secondary NVME slot because the newer one that I bought takes advantage of the faster primary NVME port.\n\n  \nHere is my build if that helps:\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JCMiller23/saved/#view=nFMcxr](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JCMiller23/saved/#view=nFMcxr)\n\n",

This wasn't anything too strange, I know it's not normal, but it had happened before and usually a reboot fixed the issue. So that's what I did. Unofrtunately this time around the PC took at least 30 secs to a minute to even power down and when it did it made a strange whir sound. I thought it was weird, but didn't pay it too much mind. When I tried to restart it I got hit with an error message from (I think) my motherboard which read: \"Your device ran into a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart it for you Stop code: DRIVER\\_IQRL\\_NOT\\_LESS\\_OR\\_EQUAL (0xD1). The PC then rebooted. When it did it gave me message saying it would attempt to fix it and then transition between steps, sich as \"Fixing issue\" and \"Establishing internet connection\" this however failed and the same error message as before popped up, except with a little extra text that read \"What failed: mtkwl6ex.sys\" The PC then rebooted again. At this point it then fails to boot by staying in the pre-bios screen (I'm not sure what it's called, but it's just a black screen with a little dash in the top left corner\" It won't move from this menu and the DRAM and CPU lights on my Mainboard are flashing. When I then power it off with the power button this entire process starts from the beginning. I have a Ryzen 7 7600, an Asrock B650M Pro RS and CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM.

It didn't come with setup instructions, but the hardware generally seemed consistent with what we've had previously.\n\nWe've connected everything, including initially just the DisplayPort cable but now both that and an HDMI cable. The end of the power cable that plugs into the wall has a yellow and green wire, I believe a grounding lead, attached to it, with a plastic cover over the connector - currently, we just have this floating freely, not touching anything, as my understanding is we don't need this in North America.\n\nOnce everything was connected, we powered it on, and immediately were hit with some questions/concerns:\n\n1) We aren't getting any video output on the monitor regardless of input (DisplayPort or the 2 HDMI inputs).\n\n2) Both XPG RAM sticks are glowing red (don't know if this is a problem or functioning as intended).\n\n3) Theres an LED button on the PC that changes the colour of the LED lights. When it's set to white, we notice a slight flickering, and we hear occasional stop-and-go \"slushing\" of liquid. When it's set to other colours, we don't notice flickering, and what we hear varies between a constant gentle \"stream\" sound and more stop-and-go slushing.\n\n4) As I'm writing this, it's been powered on for a little bit, and now we don't hear the liquid. Maybe all of the liquid sounds, both constant and stop-and-go, were just during the initial boot?\n\nThe one issue we are for sure having right now is no video output showing up on our monitor. Everything else is potentially working fine, we just aren't sure due to it being our first liquid-cooled PC.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

The physical windows key on my keyboard also doesn't work anymore.  \nAnd like... when I click it, it does the animation of being clicked, but nothing actually happens and the bracket doesn't open. The only way I can make it work is by going on the task manager and resetting file explorer, then it works just fine. But I have to do it every single time I turn on my PC and it's getting annoying.\n\nDoes anyone know about this problem and how to fix it?\n\nThanks in advance!",
